Dhaval Prajapati,https://www.zoma.to/ybMadOD,"<br/>Rating: 3.5/5<br/>The ambiance was fantastic! The decor is modern and elegant, creating a relaxing vibe that‚Äôs perfect for a night out. The atmosphere definitely sets the stage for what feels like a premium dining experience.<br/><br/>The food was good, and I loved their fancy and unique serving style‚Äîit made even simple dishes feel special. However, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel that the prices were way too high, especially for the more basic dishes. While I expected to pay more for the ambiance and presentation, it just didn‚Äôt seem justified for something so simple.<br/><br/>Overall, a nice place if you‚Äôre looking for an upscale experience, but the prices don‚Äôt quite match the simplicity of some dishes.

Shradha Kaul,https://www.zoma.to/wPAQel,"Well my husband told me that chai shop is having a crepe festival and we must give it a try. I'm not a crepe fan so was little sceptical about this idea and neither had much expectations.<br/><br/>As soon as we entered we were given a warm welcome by the staff, and they explained us their menu for the crepe fest. I was surprised to see that they had 11-12 varieties of crepes on the menu, sweet and savoury both, never knew savory crepes even existed üò≥<br/><br/>For savory we ordered, murg makhni crepe, this was my husband's choice as he's a huge butter chicken fan üòÅ This was served with yellow cheddar and fresh coriander mint chutney. Hands down this was the best thing we had that evening üòã<br/><br/>We also ordered a smoked salmon crepe, served with cucumber sour cream salad, capers & red onions. This was pretty decent but nothing in comparison to murg makhni crepe üòç<br/><br/>All savory crepes were prepared with buckwheat and were very healthy and light to eat.<br/><br/>After eating these 2 crepes we hardly had any space left in our tummies and still we wanted to try 2 different desserts üôà<br/>We ordered a black forest crepe, which was served with a cherry compote, vanilla cremeux, chocolate crunch. Tasted amazing with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream, absolute yum üòçüëÖ<br/><br/>The other one was banana crepe, served with forest honey, chocolate sauce & toasted almonds. The crepe was completely filled with bananas and was quite a lot for one person to finish.<br/><br/>Well after eating this all, I feel it was a good decision to try this out and the restaurant should definitely add the murg makhni crepe n black forest crepe in their menu.<br/><br/>Food was even reasonably priced for a 5 star and the portion served was also good.<br/><br/>",4,"Reviews of Chai Shop - Hyatt Regency, Ashram Road, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/chai-shop-hyatt-regency-ashram-road

They have a open set up for thier coffee and food. <br/>Was escorted to the table by the Manager and the chef came and explained the concept of cr√™pes. Cr√™pes are French delicacy,made of buckwheat(kuttu ka aata). They had both savory and dessert options available to choose from. <br/>I ordered a Filter coffee, which was a perfect brew and had a great authentic taste. <br/>I asked the Chef for his favorite Cr√™pe and he told me its Murgh Makhni Cr√™pe, so ordered that. Being a butter chicken lover, found it PERFECTLY AMAZING, that whole combination of butter chicken chunks with buckwheat cr√™pe and mint chutney. <br/>The chef offered me to try a sweet cr√™pe but I was so satisfied and so full after having Murgh Makhni Cr√™pe that there was hardly any space left for another one. <br/>I would request the managament to add these mouth watering cr√™pes to their regular menu. <br/>Highly Recommended place for relaxing and chilling!!",5,"Reviews of Chai Shop - Hyatt Regency, Ashram Road, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/chai-shop-hyatt-regency-ashram-road
Pratik Khubchandani,https://www.zoma.to/pXKMMN,"As soon as i got to know that Chai Shop was hosting a Cr√™pe festival, i'd made up my mind to check it out. What we were greeted with were about 8-10 varieties of cr√™pes, savory and sweet both. Ranging from options catering to vegetarians & non-vegetarians, the offerings seemed pretty good! We ordered the Smoked Salmon & Cucumber Sour Cream & a slightly customized Black Forest along with Basil Mascarpone.<br/><br/>While my friend enjoyed the Salmon cr√™pe, i particularly loved the Black Forest. Sadly, we were too full to try any other variety although i was certainly eyeing the Murgh Makhani cr√™pe. I really hope they include them in their menu.<br/><br/>Chai Shop, even otherwise is a good place to relax, spend a nice quiet evening among a comforting ambiance along with some light food and drink. If there's one thing i wish, it'd be for them to keep more varied desserts. Somehow they haven't attracted me enough.

It was yummy - right amount of coffee, perfect temperature and super taste.<br/><br/>Savoury Crepes --<br/><br/>Murgh Makhani Crepe - It was FANTASTIC!!! The whole combination went well and the chef is a real genius for coming up with this. Every element of this dish was rocking. The real star was the butter chicken - it was probably the BEST Butter Chicken I've had in Ahmedabad and it went so well with the Crepe, the greens and the base of mint chutney sauce. It was a dish that could brighten anyone's day and definitely one of the best dishes I've had in Ahmedabad. Super duper innovative but still so delicious and yummy.<br/><br/>Smoked Salmon Crepe - This was one for the fish lovers, the flavors of the salmon were complemented with the filling of the Crepe that had what seemed like yougurt and fresh veggies like cucumber and other greens. It was good, fish lovers would enjoy it!<br/><br/>Sweet Crepes --<br/><br/>Banana Honey Crepe - I had this one and it was super duper yummy! I love bananas and this was drizzled with honey, topped with nuts and chocolate sauce and served with a delicious scoop of vanilla ice cream. The whole dish went together fantastically well! It was filling as well.<br/><br/>Black Forest Crepe - This was probably one of the best dessert dishes I've had in a long long time! The whole concept of black forest was perfectly replicated on a crepe with each element standing out and adding a delicious dimension to the dish! Definitely a must try.<br/><br/>All in all the food was superb and the quantity was great as well! The service was great, the ambiance was amazing and everything that you look for in a good place to hangout and chill is here at Chai Shop.

We tried Ceprese, Ratatouille, Black forest and Apple cinnamon crepe. While the first two were savoury, the later ones were sweet in taste. All the crepese were egless and tasted really great. The sweetness was absolutely apt and made the favour pretty obvious. The apple cinnamon being the best of the lot. The cappaciano too was well made and went well with the crepe.

Aakib Laliwala,https://www.zoma.to/bgPwLK,Gardenia is a small restaurant and I found this place very quiet. I went there for dinner buffet on Sunday evening and to my surprise there were only few guests. And I think those who stayed at the hotel were there. I had very low expectations from this restaurant but this place serves amazing food.<br/>We were served 2 veg (hara bhara kabab and spring rolls)and 2 non veg starters (chilli chicken and kali mirch ka murgh) and they were amazing. I have tried buffet in almost all the luxury hotels in Ahmedabad but I would rate the starters of Gardenia at the top.<br/>So this place also has live pani puri and chaat counter and we were given 3-4 different dishes and they were excellent.<br/>Soup was really good. I didn't eat much from the main course. I had fish curry and rice to be specific and it was good. Noodles were average.<br/>Desserts were real let down at this place. Very average. The only suggestion I would like to give is to improve the desserts.<br/>I bought buffet dinner vouchers from nearbuy and also used nearbuy credits so it was a value deal for me. However the price for the dinner buffet was 899 + 18% tax which is slightly on a higher side.<br/>Overall it was a good experience. üòÅüëç<br/>,4,"Reviews of Gardenia - Fortune Park, Ellis Bridge, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/gardenia-fortune-park-ellis-bridge
Pooja,https://www.zoma.to/nmrNYq,"Accidentally landed here instead of Fortune landmark. Nevertheless we decided to give it a shot. They were running some Indian cuisine festival that day. <br/><br/>We started off with Fish starters and it was great in taste and that was the end of it. Next came chicken,  was missing the right amount of softness. Waste of my time to recall rest of the food we had. Simply put, it was average.<br/><br/>On two occasion, we just sat looking at our steward. Hoping that he remembers what we ordered. Finally we asked help from someone else and got the food we asked for. Not something you expect when you pay near to 2k. <br/><br/>At last we just wrapped our dinner for the sake of it and enjoyed a nice ride back to home. Best part of the evening was our ride back to home. <br/><br/>Roar<br/>Lion Singh.",3,"Reviews of Gardenia - Fortune Park, Ellis Bridge, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/gardenia-fortune-park-ellis-bridge

Abhijit Pandey,https://www.zoma.to/EmpXoQ,"19/11/2017<br/><br/>!! Very Good food with not so Good Management !!<br/><br/>After a long haul of exploring brunch serving restaurants in Ahmedabad, we ended up by landing here for the same on a bright sunny noon. <br/><br/>Brunch here costs approx INR 950 per pax all inclusive from the desk, but if you book the same via Little app it will cost you only INR 699 per pax all inclusive which is actually steal deal for brunch at this price. <br/>Coming to our experience which we had over there, it was not at all pleasent. We made a prior table reservation for 2:30 PM from the desk of restaurant and once we reached over there, the manager on duty told us that they will be shutting down the service by 3:30 PM. We told him clearly that this is actually not right, you should have told us prior in advance when we were booking as in a short span of less than an hour finishing up a buffet by tasting every varieties won't be possible. In regard to our discussion we had, he seemed to be less interested in serving us after 3:30 PM as they have to prepare for the dinner service. This we weren't actually expecting from such high standards hotels saying this to customer. This got us actually dissapointed. <br/>Though the food here was too too good and we loved every bit of it, but we were disappointed with the manager behaviour. <br/>........................................................................<br/>Coming to the food, we tried almost all the dishes in the menu display. Tbh, the menu here is not wide in number in compare to other buffet serving restaurants in Ahmedabad, but I can definitely say that every item on the display was too good starting from starters till desserts ‚ù§Ô∏è. We were literally drooling over on their food. Just a quick suggestion to the management is that they should focus a lil' bit more on Non-veg section as it is really very less in number in compare to veg section. <br/><br/>Even though I loved their food like anything, still I have not given them a higher user rating because of the behaviour by the manager on duty. <br/><br/>Food: 4.5/5<br/>Staff: 3/5<br/>Ambiance: 4/5<br/><br/><br/>",3,"Reviews of Gardenia - Fortune Park, Ellis Bridge, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/gardenia-fortune-park-ellis-bridge

Sreesaraj,https://www.zoma.to/YnQGMEz,"Greetings of the day,<br/><br/>We had reserved tables here for our special day. <br/>We started off with Sambharam & Kulliki Sarbath (recommended). <br/>For starters, we had Mutton Pepper Fry and Meen Pollichathu (average). The main course was Lobster kothu and Kundapura Koli Saaru (not recommended), after which we finished with some Filter Coffee(I have had worse) and Basundi for the sweet tooth.<br/><br/>Overall, Dravida didn't quite meet our expectations. The biggest lacuna was that the authentic flavours of South never stood out in the dishes we ordered. Also, given the price point, there needs to be more finesse in the balance of flavours and plating.

Sparsh Shah,https://www.zoma.to/ERwdnae,"The South Indian meals have always fascinated me. This year I had been waiting for Onam, so I could relish Sadhya. Earlier, I had Sadhya once and that too in Ahmedabad only, so I couldn't vouch for the authenticity of food. I chose Dravida this time because I had heard good reviews regarding their Onam Sadhya festival.<br/><br/>In the morning, I contacted Mr Suvankar Roy regarding reservations, but he replied that they don't take reservations as their policy for that day was on a first come first serve basis. Though when we reached there to our surprise they had a few tables reserved for the guests; but we didn't have to wait for our table.<br/><br/>It was just the second time I was trying a Sadhya meal, and was excited as ever.  The starters came in a few minutes after we were seated. For starters, there was Pathimugam Water, Rasam Soup, Uzhunnu Vada and Kappa Milagu Perrati. On the menu, salad 'thayir' was also mentioned, but I guess it was not served. Rasam Soup, Uzhunnu Vada & Kappa Milagu Perrati were delicious, but Pathimugam Water's taste didn't suit my tastebuds. I even repeated Uzhunnu Vada. Kappa Milagu Perrati was made from tapioca, and it was unique experience to try it. Rasam was soothing. In fact, Papads and chutneys were also served in starters. I didn't find Papad the authentic one, though all the chutneys betteroot, coconut & tomato were great.<br/><br/>The main course was served in thali. I wanted to experience Sadhya in a traditional way on Banana leaf, so I got a bit disappointed. There were many dishes in the thali as shown in the photo attached. There were plenty of curries were served with three types of breads and rice. I guess Sadhya is more about rice than breads if I am not wrong, but their main focus were on breads. Kal Dosa, Appam & Malabari Paratha were included in breads, all three were amazing. Especially Appam & Kal Dosa. Kal Dosa's texture was soft & spongy. We enjoyed Appam with Olan. Olan was prepared with White-Ash Gourd, Black Chana & Coconut Milk, and complimenting well with Appam. I also liked Keerai Masiyal, Avial & Sambar, but nothing tasted like you could say wow! I wanted to enjoy most of the curries with rice, but till the time I felt almost full.<br/><br/>In desserts, we had Payasam, Coconut Barfi & Kerala Elaichi Banana. Payasam was a tad bit sweeter for my liking and Coconut Barfi was okay.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, the food was good, but nothing you would remember for a long time. The experience was polished than the authentic one.<br/><br/>The steward (forgot his name) was on his toe all the time, he was polite & well-behaved too, but he was also nervous as well or rather I would say not well-versed with all the dishes. Apart from the names, he could not suggest us the combinations of dishes which could taste good together.<br/><br/>I paid Rs.3255/- for two for fine-dine experience.<br/><br/>It was my first time to visit Dravida, so I would like to give them a second chance for food by going there on non-festival days.",3,"Reviews of Dravida - Fortune Select, Sola, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/dravida-the-fern-sola

They had live music playing with a local young artist singing along with his guitar and you could also make song requests to him. now for the main eSSence(def not paid) of the experience: THE FOOD: it was perfect. They had a huge spread from salads made of various kinds including fish, duck, chicken and prawns(each having their own salad) but also a wide range of options especially for meat eating community. they had options such as italian grilled fish, one lamb curry various types of chicken curry and starters. Also the vegetarian spread was also quite international and covered a similarly large area. They also had separate live stations for Thai curries, pasta and pancakes. The dessert option was quite literally phenomenal. they had everything from local Indian sweets and  biscuits to international ones like cr√®me br√ªl√©e, various kinds of birthday cakes, donuts, croissants, etc. o...o...o also the pi√®ce de r√©sistance..... they had unlimited mocktails, canned drinks and all kinds of coffee and other such hot and cold beverages included in the price.

KSM,https://www.zoma.to/vRnXnye,"We visited this place on a recommendation from a local, and to our delight, it turned out to be a hidden gem. We had planned to have lunch at their rooftop restaurant but happened to stop by their ground-floor restaurant, Green House and were intrigued by their winter menu, which was entirely different. This led us to order a few dishes and to our surprise, everything exceeded our expectations. The staff‚Äôs recommendations were impeccable, making it an unforgettable dining experience.<br/><br/>Another highlight of our visit was exploring their AHMD Trunk, a museum showcasing an exquisite collection of books, artifacts, and handicrafts from various parts of India, including Pashmina shawls, Madhubani art, and more. This museum is in the 1st floor. Their curation is truly outstanding.<br/><br/>Special mention to Ms. Jayatri, a dedicated and talented new team member, who is doing phenomenal work within the museum. Her market understanding and attention to detail at such a young age is truly remarkable.

This is one of the 2 inhouse restaurants here and also the place where complimentary breakfast is served. This place has very good vibes. The service was excellent. They serve some very good Gujarati dishes. The prices are slightly on the higher side. However the experience is completely worth the price. They have both AC section as well as an outdoor section.

Though we missed gujarati farsan in the menu. <br/>The Mocktail counter served a variety of mocktails. We tried Mojito and Sunset Cooler. Both were really good. <br/>The best part of the spread as always was the Dessert counter. With more than 12 desserts on the menu, we had a gala time.

It had mild sweetness and fresh smelling red chillies that appeared to have been freshly crushed. The veggies in the food baby corn, zucchini, bell peppers (I think!), French beans were juicy and still tasted perfectly saut√©ed. I loved every bite. The rice smelled good when I opened the lid - the flavours actually filled the room. The aroma was bewitching. Whoever made this dish, it seemed made it with lot of love and reverence for his skill.

We were 11 people and entered almost last around the closing time and we had some discount vouchers with us, the staff was behaving with us like ""finish the food fast and leave the hotel asap.""

I am happy that I tried food here.. <br/><br/>We tried cream of chicken which was very bland. Chicken dhansak on my frnds recommendation, but did not like the taste of dal and chicken together. Have never tasted chicken dhansak earlier so can't comment on its taste. I loved the Murg tikka and crispy rotis.. they actually made my day.. the taste of murg tikka was sooo amazing.

Pricing is Normal. <br/><br/>Ambience is relaxing and maintained well. Extremely clean and non clumsy . Comfortable sitting . Usually quiet btwn 7pm-9pm . It adds up to the service.

Panner chilly too is authentic in taste unlike other Chinese dishes elsewhere . <br/>Menu is not filled with like 100 varieties but I am sure we always order what we have , previously at other places and I don't think anybody can feel bad about not having like 30 variety of chicken .<br/>Precise menu , but Tasty one . <br/><br/>If you want to have peaceful dinner time with family away from huzz buzz accompanied with good food , you shouldn't miss this place . <br/><br/>Ideal for date . ‚ù§Ô∏è<br/>Food <br/>Service <br/>Ambience <br/>All 4.5 /5",4,"Reviews of La Vista - Cama Hotel, Lal Darwaja, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/la-vista-cama-hotel-lal-darwaja
Eater Peter,https://www.zoma.to/qGzXYY,"When you enter La Vista after navigating your way through the Cama Hotel complex, your heart is bound to scream out in joy: ""This is what you call a RESTAURANT""!!! The beautiful and timeless dining hall consists of a heavy wooden decor but counter-balanced with exquisitely designed furniture and delicate cutlery that seems fit for a king! If you are lucky, take one of the tables overlooking the pool and the garden - it's just surreal. The ambience is great both for romantic dinner and business tours.<br/><br/>From long back, they have a sported a menu rich in Continental food (no, not just pastas and pizzas), like Chicken Stroganoff, Mutton Grilled Lamb, Chicken A La Kiev, Chicken Provential, etc., which are so masterfully done, you'd think you are sitting in some authentic European eatery! <br/><br/>They are also experts in North Indian and Awadhi cuisines - the meats actually melt in your mouth - whether chicken or mutton. Quantity is quite generous and they make you feel like they have spared nothing for you - terrific quality at a reasonable price.<br/><br/>They also host a prix-fixe buffet every evening. But since the asking price is not that steep, the menu is limited too - only 2 non-veg items, and 2-3 deserts, among other less notable veg dishes. Clearly, in terms of buffet spread, this is not anywhere near other restros, but I would say it is OK for the price offered.<br/><br/>A final word on the service: they are generally slow in serving food and slower during billing, but thankfully the crew are so polite and courteous, you would hardly be angry at them for anything.<br/><br/>Quality - 5/5<br/>Quantity - 5/5<br/>Service - 5/5<br/>Decor - 5/5<br/>Value for Money - 5/5",5,"Reviews of La Vista - Cama Hotel, Lal Darwaja, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/la-vista-cama-hotel-lal-darwaja

Manchurian, mini chicken pizza, chicken curry, paneer gravy were good. Pindi chole was my favorite and it is a must try here. The daal and rice was also very good, medium spicy onion daal tadka and soft small grained jeera rice. The desserts had 5 options. Gulab jamun was the best, also were creme brule, rum balls, chena tukda and strawberry mouse.

Juhi Gonsalves,https://www.zoma.to/yrmlx,"We intended to dine at Silver Leaf, but being a Sunday evening, Silver Leaf was packed to gills and we were too tired to go else where. Hence we walked a level up and landed at La Vista. I was glad we came here, since the ambiance was starkly different from Silver leaf and the place was much more quieter and spacious. We started with Honey Chilly glazed potatoes which were good sized potato chunks tossed in the sweet spicy sauce and spring onions. Anything fried and sweet spicy hits the spot for me. Murgh malai tikka was good, though would have preferred it to be served hot. <br/><br/>We requested for an all time favourite, Kheema Parinda from the Silver Leaf menu and the staff was kind enough to get the same for us. Spicy minced meat topped with egg and baked till the egg goes crisp...yummy. Could have been yummier with runny yolks. Murgh tikka lababdar and rotis comprised the main course and it was enough to serve three and parcel some home!!<br/><br/>The urge to find a good lasagne in Ahmedabad never dies down and in this quest I've ordered Lasagne at all the ""unitalian' places before. So yes, I ordered one here also. Also the menu had a fair share of Italian dishes, so I took a chance. The lasagne came topped with cheese and white sauce (expected), had a whole lot of gravy and chicken sitting at the base (expected), the sauce was slightly sweet (expected) and I loved it (not expected!!!).

It's a great green property with tiny lakes , small bridges , stone themed village decor bathed in beautiful yellow light . Cots with pillows will be lying around and they have a huge seating capacity of around 170 . The seating is so varied and so spread out , you'll never feel crowded . There is space and privacy .<br/><br/>Traditional music and dance is available for entertainment where you'll be served a welcome drink.<br/>From here you can explore and go wherever you want . To the cute puppet show or maybe get some mehendi designs or have your future told by the astrologer.<br/>You can go straight for dinner too .<br/><br/>FOOD<br/>Everything they serve is authentic and delicious. The menu keeps changing .<br/>What I had was<br/>Welcome drink<br/>Salad platter having cut vegetables , chutneys ( Green , Garlic , Khajur ) Athanu , Marcha<br/>A dry salad made of Dal<br/>Four sabzis - Bataka raswala , Cholafali , Ringan dungri and Dudhi kofta - tasted fabulous, especially the cholafali had my heart .<br/>Three carbs - Bajra no rotlo , Bhakri , Methi thepla . Bhakri was authentic and not the biscuit type served elsewhere<br/>This was served with a tub of unsalted butter<br/>Two kadhis - Rajasthani and Gujarati<br/>Two sweets - Moong no Halwo which was amazing and Malpua<br/>Methi dhokla was perfectly soft and fluffy and well flavored<br/>Fried Patra tasted great too . I don't like Patra but because it was fried it gave a nice crunch to it and made it great<br/>Papad - normal and khichiya<br/>Khichdi - can be improved was a little bland<br/>Anjeer ice cream - was a tad bit boring after such a great meal. It was vanilla ice cream with anjeer pieces<br/><br/>Service<br/>It's polite and respectful . They don't disturb you too much which is a blessing. You can eat Peacefully and request items as you require.<br/><br/>Overall it's a fabulous must visit place especially on a special occasion.<br/><br/>I didn't like three things<br/>1. The entertainment available is great but most of them expect some money to be given . It was a little uncomfortable. I don't mind giving but not everyone would want to .<br/>2. The parrot used by the astrologer. It's down right animal cruelty and the restaurant should not associate itself with such people.<br/>3. Malpua can be crispier and taste even better if served with rabdi<br/>Peace !<br/><br/>",5,"Reviews of Rajwadu, Vejalpur, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/rajwadu-vejalpur

No shopping malls, no restaurants, no offices, nothing. Once in, you stay cooped up and cannot venture much outside.<br/><br/>2)	No card swipe access, this is the ordinary keyhole and metal key affair.<br/><br/>3)	Medium sized linear room. Old fashioned style. A very low ceiling‚Äôed one at that.<br/><br/>4)	Lumpy pillows but a decent mattress. Average sleep quality.<br/><br/>5)	Excellent roadside view from the sixth-floor French window pane.<br/><br/>6)	A small couch, a glass top centre table and a writing desk too.<br/><br/>7)	Less than adequate no of phone/laptop charging points. Only on one side of the bed. Poor thinking.<br/><br/>8)	Small size bathroom too. A curtain affair ‚Äì but well enclosed such that there was no water spillage outside.<br/><br/>9)	Basic frills in the bathroom. A shaving mirror. A weighing scale. No Hairdryer. Clean linen. Pressure pumped water from the shower.<br/><br/>10)	32 inch Samsung LCD TV. No HD Channels.<br/><br/>11)	Less than adequate lighting. Yellow light bulbs. A thumbs down.<br/><br/>12)	Two 1000 ml mineral water bottle complimentary. Good going.<br/><br/>13)	Excellently working WiFi<br/><br/>14)	Excellently working AC.<br/><br/>The Postlude:<br/><br/>============================================<br/><br/>I had great expectations from Lemon Tree and this was my first visit to the brand.

Aryan Rahul,https://www.zoma.to/lqmGYd,"Good hotel but service needs to be fast . Good Hotel. A social business that re-invests its profits into education, training and entrepreneurship.¬†Hotel ratings¬†are often used to classify¬†hotels¬†according to their quality. The development of the concept of hotel rating and its associated definitions display strong parallels. From the initial purpose of informing travellers on basic facilities that can be expected, the objectives of hotel rating has expanded into a focus on the hotel experience as a whole.[1]¬†Today the terms 'grading', 'rating', and 'classification' are used to generally refer to the same concept, that is to categorize hotels.<br/><br/>There is a wide variety of rating schemes used by different organizations around the world. Many have a system involving¬†stars, with a greater number of stars indicating greater luxury.¬†Forbes¬†Travel Guide, formerly¬†Mobil¬†Travel Guide, launched its star rating system in 1958. The¬†AAA¬†and their affiliated bodies use¬†diamonds¬†instead of stars to express hotel and restaurant ratings levels.<br/><br/>Food services, entertainment, view, room variations such as size and additional amenities, spas and fitness centers, ease of access and location may be considered in establishing a standard. Hotels are independently assessed in traditional systems and rest heavily on the facilities provided. Some consider this disadvantageous to smaller hotels whose quality of accommodation could fall into one class but the lack of an item such as an¬†elevator¬†would prevent it from reaching a higher categorization.[2]<br/><br/>In recent years hotel rating systems have also been criticised by some[who?]¬†who argue that the rating criteria for such systems are overly complex and difficult for laypersons to understand. It has been suggested that the lack of a unified global system for rating hotels may also undermine the usability of such schemes.<br/><br/>",4,"Reviews of Citrus Cafe - Lemon Tree  Hotel, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/citrus-cafe-lemon-tree-hotel-navrangpura

We visited for dinner in a group of 8 people. Seating arrangement is very comfortable and spacious. We started with hot and sour soup, Mexican chilly bean soup and turkish kumpir. Soups were very good in taste and turkish kumpir had very rich stuffing in to backed potatoes. Then we had margarita pizza, mumbai magic¬† pizza, dragon Manchurian, Arabiata pasta, Bangkok red curry and wok fried rice. We liked all the dishes especially Pizzas and pasta.",5,"Reviews of Piperade - The Waterside, Adalaj, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/piperade-the-waterside-adalaj
Nirav Sanghvi,https://www.zoma.to/kMRLlle,"This place is AWESOME to visit during winter an summer due to its location and way it's setup. If you visit during monsoon you will be badly disappointed. Because of its outdoor ambience and pure candle light dinner with lovely music experience It's also famous for dating and young couples. Although we never faced issue even visiting with children and family.<br/><br/>Their Italian and Mexican food is different then other restaurants but will still give it 4.5/5 base on taste, uniqueness and quality.<br/>Their sizzlers were once really awesome but quality of sizzlers has went down in past few years.<br/>They also have separate indoor Punjabi restaurant with different name which is good but not outstanding. Doesn't makes sense either to travel outside city at such distance to seat indoor and eat Punjabi.<br/><br/>So far visited this place multiple times on birthday anniversary etc (from October to June) and tried different dishes and will give 4.5/5 for overall experience.<br/>For visits between June to October (monsoon) will give 2.0/5<br/><br/>Overall 4.5/5",5,"Reviews of Piperade - The Waterside, Adalaj, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/piperade-the-waterside-adalaj

Radhika Thacker,https://www.zoma.to/NAZGNwl,"This place is near my work place..I have been here a couple of times...with my work friends...today we visited there with family, I like the elaborate menu, the continental dishes, the sitting arrangement, the live music part...<br/><br/>Now I will come to my negative experience this time, the person assigned to our table was the reason...I can't have  ice cream at all because of some personal reason, whenever I order sizzling brownie, I always request to give ice cream separately, never have anyone said no for this , because it is a very simple thing , you put ice cream in a separate bowl rather than on the brownie, the person serving us directly said no before even listening to what I was saying, giving the reason that it is going busy, how does it makes sense, it is a very simple request, how can you directly say no, I explained to him that it is not that big of a thing and wont take much time...he refused to listen, I was very disappointed and asked to cancel the whole brownie thing, he sensed that I was upset, I might complain, so he came back ..took the order.<br/><br/>Now for them it is a very small thing, but by doing this you are showing the you are least bothered about your customer and hospitality you provide.<br/><br/>How can you directly say no to something which is this simple...you ruin the whole experience by doing so...<br/>People ask me about good places to eat, now after this experience how can I suggest this place to someone who wants to bring their family and their guests to a good dining place..<br/>Beside this as I said , food , menu options, ambience was good.<br/>I would like to say that when you are in this business , hospitality matters a lot, and you people should focus on their training and way of interaction with people.",3,"Reviews of Italian Bistro - Maple 99, Chandkheda, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/italian-bistro-maple-99-chandkheda

Their Pan Asian cuisine is one of the best I can list. <br/><br/>All-time fav - Spring Rolls, Tom Yum Soup, Tofu in Plum Sauce, Water chestnut in Plum Sauce, Veg Tempura, Vegetable Stroganoff, Mexican Rice with Curry, Thai Green Curry with Rice, and Stir-Fried Rice with Crispy Spinach. <br/><br/>My family does love their Indian cuisine.

Kachori and samosa is must try here.,4,"Reviews of Indore Chat House, Paldi, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/indore-chat-house-paldi
Dr. Rama Moondra,https://www.zoma.to/KvXbby,Don't even expect any cleanliness or hygiene factors. I think it is deliberate attempt to not even clean the platforms where people keep plates and eat. But indeed the kachori is real good. Stuffed and freshly prepared. Samosas are really ok types. More like an alu paratha beaten to death and it curled to save itself. Go if you're real junkie else you wouldn't miss much.,3,"Reviews of Indore Chat House, Paldi, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/indore-chat-house-paldi
Mayank Solanki,https://www.zoma.to/LMqpeM,"Indore chat house is one of my favourite place, I use to go there twice or thrice a month. They are exclusively selling only two items SAMOSA & KACHORI, both are very testy, fresh and serving hot with chatni.<br/>There is always little queue at counter when I go there in evening. There is arrangement inside the shop, where u can eat & have cold drinking water. They don't use onion and garlic so swaminarayan and Jain can go and try it without hesitation. I personally recommend to try KACHORI here.<br/>",4,"Reviews of Indore Chat House, Paldi, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/indore-chat-house-paldi

Kathak Mehta,https://www.zoma.to/BYPKn,"Stopped by to dig into sizzling hot dalwada on a rainy day. It was heavy downpour and not that I was stuck in the rain but had some work that had to be done inspite of the rain. So it was already raining when I started and had decided to make a stop enroute at New Gujarat. The immediate road leading to this place was flooded and it was still raining heavily but dalwada was an urge not to be overlooked. And thus I reach at New Gujarat to face a huge crowd of people waiting to be served dalwada. And to my utter surprise, the person at the counter served me dalwada instantly. One time when I did not mind getting undue benefit being a girl!<br/><br/>So what I love about the dalwada here is that they make them large enough to devour each piece. Moreover, the dalwadas here are consistently well fried. Served with green chilli like at all other places, dalwada at New Gujarat stand out for the right amount of oil they use. <br/><br/>Ambika and Gujarat dalwada have their own deserving popularity and I also like dalwadas at Ambika equally. But I would say, this place is not worth missing out! <br/><br/>Monsoon is round the corner.

The Chef From India,https://www.zoma.to/KdRGBO,"Just one thing that I don't like is the oddly priced products.

Shreya Vyas,https://www.zoma.to/DDRplR,"Now i have known the paldi branch since i was 8 which i love already. I always wait there whenever i am in paldi area for delicious samosas and kachori. Once when i was returning home from satellite via mansi crossroads i saw this small shop which announced Indore chat house. I was extremely happy as now i didn't had to travel from drive in road to paldi. But then first i had to be sure that they are the genuine indore chat house. There was no doubt  of me not trying the new branch. So i ate a kachori there itself and decided to take two samosas as take away. The staff is neither rude nor friendly , Just normal. The ambiance is not too attractive either. Just a small tiny shop having a few stools in the indoors. And moreover it has no ventilation and is quite hot inside.The kachori was served with two mixed chutneys i.e. the sweet brown chutney and spicy pudina chutney. The consistency of chutneys was very thin though tasty. The kachori was hot, fresh , crispy and delicious but to my badluck it was moong dal kachori. I like the onion kachoris more. The samosas which i took as take away had remained hot and did not become soggy unlike the other places. The same old taste of spicy delicious samosas with generous amount of filling filled into it. However the mixed chutneys had changed to color. It went black dont know why. I suggest eating eating at around 4 pm for freshly made samosas and kachoris. Moreover they should add onion kachoris in their menu. And i suggest while you eat take your plate outside to avoid suffocation. Overall a few negative points for.poor ambiance and the ""color changing chutney"" when you take it as take away.",3,"Reviews of Indore Chat House, Satellite, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/indore-chat-house-satellite
Vishwas,https://www.zoma.to/yMGbL,"Fellow foodies, Greetings of the Day..!! <br/><br/>Today, I'll review this eatery which is serving Samosa & Kachori since a decade and more; 'coz I remember getting piping hot samosas just after coming from college which is good old memory of 10-12 years.<br/><br/>There was a time when this eatery served Khaman & Fafda (both discountinued since long), Kachori and Samosa and special mention to their mix chutney (the guy at the counter takes one dipper mithi (sweet khajoor chutney) chutney and one diipper of spicy chutney in same packet.<br/><br/>In fact, I know 5 patrons of this eatery who live in Sabarmati and have cloth processing house in Narol; they visit this place  every week, to have their samosa/kachoris, while going back to home since 10-12 years. By this, you can gauge the popularity of its samosas and kachori sold @ rs. 10 each.<br/><br/>This joint do have make shift standing counters inside the eatery where you can tinlge your taste buds. <br/><br/>Here, after you place your order, you will get samosa/kachori in a plate where the guy at the counter will crush it and pour the special chutney over it.<br/><br/>Moreover, since 9-10 years; I've never faced a moment where I wouldn't had to stand in queue to get my take away.<br/><br/>Special Tip: Go around 08:30-08:45 or 16:00-16:15 to get the piping hot samosas & kachoris, but be prepared to stand in long queue.

Returning from a restaurant at the highway me and a few of my friends wanted to have something which is cool and fresh and sweet thus we decided to eat ice-golas but then on our way we saw this tiny place for fresh sugarcane juice. We immediately changed our minds and stopped here. Ambiance is quite normal. A small shop, which has a few bamboo stools kept at the outdoor but the interior is well designed by a few green hangings which gives a fresh look to the shop. We were  around 4 people and wanted to order different flavors of cane juice. They serve salt & pepper, lemon , mint and a few other. We didn't go for salt &pepper, i mean salt with sugarcane? So we ordered mint , lemon , just sugarcane juice and one more which i don't remember. They took around 2 minutes to make our juices. They make it front of you ensuring that it isn't one which is made hours ago. The size of the glasses were not up to the mark. I found them small, maybe this is because i loved the drink too much. The other flavors i.e. mint and lemon were good enough but me being a natural food loved found the authentic sugarcane juice just awesome. Yes the consistency was a big lead down. The gurantee full hygienicity as it is made without human touch. But the consistency of the juice was so thin. Natural cane juice isn't so less consistent, but who is gonna question the honesty of a machine. Anyways all matters is you like what you eat or drink which was completely fulfilled.I am happy that it is near my house and so i can be a regular customer there.

They  have 3 outlets across Ahmedabad and we decided to visit their outlet located right at Gota Circle on Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway.<br/><br/>When we reached the outlet, the popularity of this place was evidenced by the hordes of people impatiently waiting around the cash counter to get their share of this delicacy. While waiting for our turn, we also caught a glimpse of their kitchen where 2 guys were dedicatedly frying three huge batches of Dal Vadas in smoking hot oil in large kadhais.<br/><br/>We got to know from the guy manning the counter that the sole reason of their popularity is the quality of ingredients they use and that they prepare their Dal Vadas fresh almost all the time so if you visit their outlet during any time of the day, there are very high chances that you will always get the fresh hot Dal Vadas taken out of the kadhai just a few minutes ago.",4,"Reviews of Shree Ambika Dalvada Centre, Gota, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/shree-ambika-dalvada-centre-gota

Yesha Chokshi,https://www.zoma.to/exvpzO,Ambika dalwada has been our favourite eating place on rainy days ever since I started staying at sola!! It is really near from the place I stay!! I had been to this place numerous times before but finally writing review today!! Today it rained cats and dogs in Ahmedabad despite of the fact that it's still may !! I took an impromptu visit to ambika with my colleagues !! They serve really tasty hot and crisp  dalwada !! (Don't count calories) I would say a must have during rainy days!! This place is usually studded with bunch of people.they have separate queue for male and female. Being a girl it's easy to get dalwada as only few female were there contrary to long male queue!!

Vishwas,https://www.zoma.to/DAOeb,"Greetings fellow foodies...!!<br/><br/>Team Zomato: They have increased the rates, so tie up your shoes and upload the latest price chart.<br/><br/>Well, coming back to my review: I have been a die hard fan of all the offerings of Moti Bakery, whether it is ""Palak Paneer""/""Paneer Bhurji"" Puff or ""College Pizza"".<br/><br/>As far as my knowledge goes, they must be using generous amount of ""Egg yolks"" to make their bread too soft and fluffy, there's one other ingredient too to for the same purpose but I won;t name it 'coz I didn't had it's after taste.<br/><br/>So to the square one, they are too pocket freindly with their stuff. You can give a miss to their pastries: but if you are considering ""Value for Money"" then their pastries can outsmart (the recent outlets @ Satellite, Ambavadi & Navrangpura) by a fairly good margin.<br/><br/>As far as Puff comes into picture, there ain't any proper competitor since decades ('coz I am visiting Moti Bakery, Lal Darwaza since alomost 2 decades) & haven't find a heir; or proper word can be near-clone to their Puffs.<br/><br/>I am sure, the connosieurs (in fact, Amdavadi Zomato community)  over here would have tasted the offering/s may be once or couple of times; however if this ain't the picture then I would suggest you quickly make a move to this place: whether Lal Darwaza or Sarkhej.",4,"Reviews of Moti Bakery, Sarkhej, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/moti-bakery-sarkhej

Sangani Pooja,https://www.zoma.to/DDrbQKA,"Simply Good Food!!<br/><br/>I ordered Gulkand Almond Kharek from Shree Manmohan Kharek Center  today via Zomato. 150/- for one bowl serves three people. (Depends upon appetites) I relished my cravings for tingling taste and mouthwatering aroma of Kharek. <br/><br/>While my visit to the shop I enjoyed pineapple, flavoured kharek. This time I tried a flavoured version of kharek infused with gulkand and almond added a little bit of tangy taste to a sweet bowl with a dash of lemon. This bowl is a mixture of gulkand which has cooling properties, thus it is beneficial in alleviating all heat-related problems like tiredness, lethargy, itching, aches and pains. Also, shredded coconut was added which gives an exotic kick and crunch to the dish. Mostly it reminds me of my childhood days where I used to eat masala kharek that comes in yellow foil packing. It was my favourite timepass. But now I love to eat this smashed version of khareks with all different flavours and masalas. <br/><br/>These dry dates become my favourite after-meal snack or say digestive aid which I will widely use as a mouth freshener, especially after my meals.<br/><br/>Thank you<br/>Pooja Sangani<br/>Pooja's Way<br/><br/>#poojasway #justicefoodie #kharek #drydates #flavouredkharek #GulkandAlmond #mukhvaslover #aftermeal #bestforbody #foodwriter #creativewriting #flavourfulkharek #ahmedabadfoodstories #foodblogger #ahmedabadfoodie  <br/>",5,"Reviews of Shree Manmohan Kharek Centre, C G Road, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/shree-manmohan-kharek-centre-navrangpura

Kathak Mehta,https://www.zoma.to/XYEPg,"Samosas at Gita is a great option for late afternoon snack time. There is no parallel of samosas here. They make the most crispy, wholesome and tasty samosas just for Rs. 10/- a piece. A plate of samosa contains two pieces. The taste of samosa lingers in the mouth till evening. Best part - not too spicy yet very tasty and you wouldn't even notice the oil inspite of being deep fried. Samosas is not just their specialty but Gita samosa is a brand in itself. Khasta kachori is another of their house specialty. The stuffing of Khasta kachori is nutritious as well as delicious to taste. They serve both samosa and kachori mashed with tangy and spicy chatni. Inside the shop they have made arrangement for tables where you can stand and have the food but more often then not, getting it parceled is a great idea. They also serve the famous navtad samosas which are miniature samosas popular from a place in the old city.",3,"Reviews of Gita Samosa Centre, Vejalpur, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/gita-samosa-centre-satellite

Later on, they started with panipuri in a shop, right at the same place where it is right now, adding up ""Sev Puri"" and ""Dahi Puri"", there sales and popularity just boosted up, at present they are the dominators for "" Sev puri"" Dahi puri"" and "" Bhel"", These are the three dishes which you could find in each corner on the streets of Ahmedabad, but still when it comes to the best, you might find only a single name and that is ""Diwan"". The only surprising thing here is that, that they don't need marketing and varieties of dishes in the menu to confuse people, they are famous with just 4 dishes. and thats something which I would count as an achievement. # Amazing place for a weekend refreshment # Perfect place for a mood change with spicy and tangy pani puris and Sev puris # Just perfect",5,"Reviews of Diwan Bhel Pakodi Centre, Satellite, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/diwan-bhel-pakodi-centre-satellite

Hungry Young Man - AmisH,https://www.zoma.to/KevYlXz,"It was quite early in the morning, and I was seriously famished. Also, this place not being Mumbai, I had given up on any street food breakfast stalls, let alone any restaurants to be operational this early in the day. I was on a bus, and this locality, despite being very close to Ahemdabad's¬†main railway junction, looked very vintage with the old style architecture and no proper buildings and stuff. Just then my eyes crossed this only building standing tall, and there it was"" Moti Bakery, open and ready to serve. I literally got off the bus and walked in to get something in my growling stomach.¬†<br/><br/>I did not have very high hopes, even some puff or samosa would be good enough, but what did we have here, they also served Pizza, burgers, and rolls! Lucky me! Well, sadly this particular outlet of the popular brand of Moti Bakery did not serve non-veg, but for a hungry young man such as myself, even ghass-phoos would make me more than happy at the moment.<br/><br/>I liked this bakery and its products so much that I ended up coming here thrice in the 2 days I was at Ahemdabad! Not only that, but I also took sweets and munchies back home from here too. Moti bakery was sort of a lifesaver, as I did not have to look around a lot for getting some edible souvenirs from Ahemdabad, and it offered amazing snacking and dessert options!<br/><br/>I tried their pizza, paneer rolls, and paneer puff in savories, for the sweet dish it was ras malai and gulab jamun, with a box of milk cake and Mohanthad for home. I also got a box of their assorted cookies, which had at least¬†8 different types of cookies in it, and their super crunchy and buttery breadsticks which tasted delicious just by themselves, offering a salty as well as sweet tang. Each and every product was loveable! I wouldn't mind stepping in here for a quick grub when I am in Ahemdabad next, and its proximity¬†to the railway junction would even allow me to do so practically! Loved this establishment!<br/><br/>Happy Burping!!!",4,"Reviews of Moti Bakery, Kalupur, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/moti-bakery-kalupur

Rs. 25.

But I was wrong. Point 1. It was not chilled and not fresh. Point 2. It was not made with fresh cream and tasted so blunt. My taste treat was completely opposite to the visual treat. Then I ordered paneer chilli. The covering bun seemed big but the stuffing is very less. Priced at Rs. 25 per piece, there were hardly 2-3 pieces of paneer. Not a good experience for a bakery.

Savan Parmar,https://www.zoma.to/BgkmdD,"Its been over 20 years when i tried their dalwada for very first time and after all these years i will admit that there is not even 1% change in the taste. This place was introduced to me by my late Grandpa who was big fan of their dalwada. Big pieces of dalwada and methi gota always served hot is their speciality.<br/><br/>I have seen them grow their business from a road side Lari to well established shop. My school was next to this place and i still remember my class teacher during recess time asks us to get dalwada and bhajia from here, and when we come back with parcel they give us 1 piece dalwasa or 1 piece bhajia as a thank you. And for young student that was no less than diwali bonus.<br/><br/>One can get take away and also eat there. Previously if you want to eat there ony then there were banches where you can have snacks. In recent changes made in the shop they got rid of the banches and placed round high tables.<br/><br/>Ambiance: only part on whicch they should concentrate more. Because lots of people have dalwada and bhaia there only it is bit massy.. event hough they keep tables clean one could easily dind pieces of snacks on d floor.<br/><br/>Must Have: they serve only Dalwada and Methi Gota so there is nothing to choose that what to eat and what to not. But they are master of Dalwada. Good thing about place is that they make considerably small batch of dalwada and methi Gota at a time so one will never get cold item there. They serve both dalwada and got with sliced onions and green chilli.<br/><br/>Avoid: nothing that one can skip<br/><br/>Area of improvement: they need to work bit more on cleanliness. Also previously they had Kachori and Samosa on the menu and i still feel that in whole mani nagar area no one was serving such delicious kachori ad samosa. Somehow they have stopped making kachori and Samosa. I really wish these two items are still available.<br/><br/>They serve from 10am to 8:30pm, sometimes 9pm max. But after 7:30pm chances of getting dalwada starts decreasing rapidly. Sometimes have seen them winding up days business at 8pm only.<br/><br/>3 generation of my family is fan of the place. Grandpa then dad and me, and i know my young daughter will also grow up liking this place also. From my 20+ years of experience of this place made me give it 5 as rating.<br/><br/>Food: 5/5<br/>Ambiance: 3/5<br/>VFM: 5/5<br/>",5,"Reviews of Vijay Ratlami Dalwada Centre, Kankaria, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/vijay-ratlami-dalwada-centre-kankaria

It is open till midnight on weekends. Mostly, it attracts all the age group of people be it a small kiddo or be it an old age group. Everyone comes here to refresh themselves.<br/><br/>The place have something curiotic in it. People can sit chat dance roam and do mant more things here with their group. Also, its a good place for couples too! (though i personally don't recommend to bring your date here).<br/><br/>However, these place has got so many options for foodies. Be it a large size oven-pizza or be it a small dessert cuppa. You can get almost everything you wish to have here except north indian, european food, thai as well labanese. I love the food served here. (Be prepare to serve yourself-TABLE SERVING ISNT AVAILABLE HERE ). We have tried almost everything out there. The most popluar thing in this entire junction is PURE BEANS & CREAM !!<br/><br/>The coffee served by Pure beans is the most authentic as well as versatile in taste. One can literally feel like drinking a coffee made rightaway from the beans !!üòç (Only coffee lovers can understand)<br/><br/>For the rest, i would say many a times there isnt any space available for seating just because of excess crowd.<br/><br/>They also have clean washrooms. Wheelchairs are easily accessible here. Go to go place for Adults !! I would suggest not to bring your kiddo's here.<br/><br/>The Food served here is little costlier then you have taken till date.

A little ghotala is left to be wrapped in an utterly buttery dosa and rest of shiny red ghotala is served in a separate plate to complement the dosa. The Ghotala is insanely cheesy and addictively delicious. You will finish the food by licking the plate. The testimony of this dosa is given by flocks of people gathered here to eat this.

A lots of snacks stall situate in manek Chowk night market.<br/>You can see different dosas being cooked on hot griddles. I had picked, out of 50 varieties, ""Ghotala dosa"" for myself. Frankly speaking, I didn't tell what all had been added to this Ghotala dosa like onion, tomatoes, spinach, cheese, cottage cheese, and a lot more. It was wonderful to watch this dosa being cooked And the unique thing about this dosa was that the filling prepared with a lot of effort was served not inside, but on the side of the dosa. How was that for a unique Ghotala dosa!<br/>Along with dosa, I had sambar, curd & chutney. This dosa taste a bit different from the usual dosas made with a mix of rice, suji, besan & urad dal. This dosa was normal, nothing extraordinary, in terms of overall taste but filling was the gamechanger, the 6-7 ingredients put. Into this filling had come together at an amazing level of flavor. All the ingredients has mixed together beautifully and the result was a scrumptious combination.<br/>In fact, I felt like leaving the dosa aside and just focus on that tasty filling.

Tushti Bhatia,https://www.zoma.to/DdqKgk,"Alot of food blogger friends of mine recommended me this place to try some really unique and different  flavourful burgers if am super bored of the Regular Burger brands like Mc‚Äôd and burger farm. So on their recommendation i swiggy‚Äôed some of their bestselling and quirky named burgers. So i ordered aloo tikki burger, mexican twist burger, simply veg burger and kadhai paneer burger and some french fries to accompany it with. To start with kadhai paneer burger, it was stellar, i just loved how soft the bun were and the burger had exactly the same flavours that kadhai paneer has. The aloo tikki burger was quite the usual, simply veg burger was a great one and the patty was crispy and yum. I dint like the veg wrap though, it had alot of sauces and spices and it was quite difficult to chew. The french fries were crisp from the outer and soft from inside and i quite like it. The best thing i think about burgerlicious is that it is quite pocket friendly and had a good taste as compared to all the cafes and food places ahmedabad has, this one is the best place.

A place renowned for it‚Äôs samosa and Kebabs. No parking available you have to park on the side and if there is a lot of traffic then forget it. Small shop not suitable for families as lot of bachelors and single folk visit this place.You can much rather do take away and enjoy at your home. Once you start eating the kebab and samosa you will find it very dry and there is no mayo or sauce to go with the food . Soft drinks and tea are also not available and after your throat tends to get very dry.¬† I went there last Sunday and I felt the samosa and Kebab rather oily and the Kebab was less meaty and more onion and masala. Samosa is crispy but I felt it little too oily. Although this place has been around a long time the shop is not well maintained and antique.A group of four people can sit together on¬† 1 bench and there is limited seating arrangement.

They start serving the food early in the morning around 6:00 am. And they close it around 8:30-9:00 am in morning. One thing i like about them is , they do not compromise with quality and food is same like home made food. You can see that place is too clean. Aged couple is running this shop and they cook all these things by themselves.<br/>So here are few things that you can try there.<br/><br/>1. Sambhar vada - (serves on wednesday, friday, sunday)<br/>2. Idli sambhar<br/>3. Masala dosa<br/>4. Podi masala dosa<br/>5.

Crispy dosa, chutney and sambhar are a pair made in heaven !! We go nuts about it !!!<br/>They are closed on Mondays and jain Sambhar is available only on Sundays.<br/><br/>Idli and morning is a combo made for eachother !! You know you will have a good day ahead after a hearty breakfast like this. We had this idli topped with coconut chutney, onion podi chutney and sambhar at food station (which remember stocks out at 9:30am) we loved it !!

Uttapam sprinkled with ample Podi.<br/>Idli - As fresh and soft as it can get<br/>Masala Dosa - A dosal lovers delight<br/>Ghee roast Dosa - A South Indian speciality. Crispy Dosa Roasted in ghee.

Starting from Idli, Vada to different dosas including podi dosas and delicious Uttapams. Loved and enjoyed each one of them. So their speciality includes Podi Dosasa which are normal dosas with podi masala spread and they are different served in different varieties like onion, masala, cheese onion, cheese masala. Everything there is worth a try. They are quite reasonable speaking as a college student. They serve Vada thrice a week only. Their vada is different from others as it is made with bottle gourd and daal mixture. Cheese dosas here are amazing as well.

They ordered gulab jamun,sukhadi(which the king of the dish),khaman,kadhi,roti,thepla( awesome),four diff.sabjis( mix veg,chana,baingan,potatoes). Taste of sabjis was average. Kadhi nd khichdi also in my platter. They serve hajma hajam as cooler which has tangy flavour and I liked it most. Bucket of salads were also there. Overall the food was above the average.<br/><br/>Now.let me write about the place - ambience. Mainly, Goras has Rajasthani + Rajwadi theme based place - where you found Rajasthani folk singer who sings Rajasthani songs as well as Gujarati on harmonium. These adds sparkle to this place. <br/><br/>Enjoyed a lot last night. Worth to spend your money here.

Yesha Chokshi,https://www.zoma.to/KBwKoO,"Situated near gota cross roads.. good place for dinner outing and 'dhaba' style experience.. i was fascinated fron the begining with its haveli kind of huge and sturdy entrance.. they have tried to creat a village atmosphere.. but i loved the most about decor is the uneven cut table design with low sitting.. never go for other cusine than gujju/kathitavadi in such place!! I loved everything from bajara rotla with ghee-gol ,thepla,rignan nu bhadtu,sev tameta to end with vaghareli khichdi and kadhi!! Stuffed bhajiya-capsicum ,tomato,potato-were hot ,spicy ,crisp ,with lot of garlic!! Khajur anjeer vadmi for ending the dinner!! Dont forget to order buttermilk!!

Shreyansh,https://www.zoma.to/gZdRn,"First time i went their accidently.but then i realised that it is a nice place to hangout. They have enough space so i don't feel conjusted there. The main reason to hangout there is u feel like sorrounded by nature. Before food they do prayers. There is puppet show, folk music. Khat is there to pass your time with your loved ones. One must try paneer tikka and dal batti over there. They should add cusines and they must IMPROVE THEIR SERVICE. if they work on these issues, i am sure that they have bright future.",3,"Reviews of Goras, Gota, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/goras-gota
Ruchit Darji,https://www.zoma.to/AbnLB,"One Sunday we were passing by SG Highway and we have decided to give a try to Goras and it was worthful.<br/><br/>We weren't known to speciality of Goras so we have opt for regular Fu -Jabi and Dal-Bati.<br/><br/>Once food was served with the smell only you can guess the quality of food. Fun-Jabi was real in taste, tandoor was too good. Dal-Bati you can say 4/5.<br/><br/>Ambiance is too good and Staff was supportive. <br/><br/>We have decided to visit regularly then.",4,"Reviews of Goras, Gota, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/goras-gota
Kushani,https://www.zoma.to/DAYPO,"All of us friends winded up our uttarayan this year with dinner at Goras.<br/><br/>I haven't been to a typical village/earthy set up restaurant since I was a child and was consequently fascinated and ended up having a great time!<br/>On arrival we were informed that the waiting was 1 hour.  This actually turned out to be a waiting of around 20 mins; there is this strange anti-intuitive custom in Ahmedabad restaurants of giving the guests a higher waiting time than what actually turns out in the end. Anywho, while we were waiting, they lit up a fire for us while we sat on jute string charpais with a folk artist singing in the background. I was so warm and cuddly and well entertained that I sincerely didn't want to enter the eating area proper when the time came. <br/><br/>But enter we did and ordered food like no one had fed us for a week. There were 4 dal battis, 2 paneer tikka masala, 2 lasaniya bataka, chaas, soup, masala papads, paneer chilly, rotis. Everything was very nice; the subzis were flavorful, the rotis buttery and dal batti really good (Shiv Shakti is still the best though).<br/><br/>Go for the feel, the fire on cold winter nights; the food's a plus.<br/><br/>(Edit: I had a slight stomach upset the next day, nothing major, but it was there. Still like the place.)",3,"Reviews of Goras, Gota, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/goras-gota

And I agreed. <br/><br/>The Dutch Truffle cake looked simple from the outside, pretty much average. But all the magic lied in there! As basic as it seemed, it was only as much delicious. A bit dark chocolaty with a hint of coffee, absolutely sinful! It was soft to the extent that it was tough to get hold of a slice trying to eat. <br/><br/>Extremely well prepared in around 45 mins, who ever ate this cake, had their eyes popping out in surprise, wondering who made this totally outstanding cake!

Walked in after seeing the poster for the Honey Ginger icecream and that's what I ordered. The place feels value for money as the icecream scoops served are generous and reasonably priced. The honey ginger icecream flavour was delicious, with a subtle honey and stronger ginger flavour coming through and with just enough sweetness to make it delicious. I loved the fact that the icecream wasn't cloyingly sweet as seems to be the norm for most dessert places in Ahmedabad unfortunately. I will try to come back soon for the chocolate brownie flavour that has been recently introduced!",5,"Reviews of Patel Ice Cream, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/patel-ice-cream-navrangpura

Though the chocolate ganache tasted as good as expected. <br/><br/>Overall, not a great experience and one should stick to Dangee Dums or Vanilla, which are around the same vicinity! <br/><br/>(1 pic)",3,"Reviews of House of Cakes, Memnagar, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/house-of-cakes-memnagar

Binoy Vasavada,https://www.zoma.to/lQoaDn,"Sizzling Brownie is a drive side laidback dessert place located just ahead of Thakar Thal on SG highway. This place is run by two part time entrepreneurs - young, friendly and ambitious PINANG and VIVEK. The place's highlight is that they only sell about 10 types of Sizzling brownies and they are undoubtedly the cheapest ones you'll find in entire Ahmedabad or even India! A unique concept that's catchy and promising if strategized, marketed and executed properly.<br/><br/>Ambience has nothing but empty dim lit space.  You easily get a feeling of a startup at an embryonic stage. <br/><br/>Menu has decent options starting with Evergreen Brownie- The classic Vanilla ice cream meets brownie and sizzling chocolate sauce priced eye poppingly at Rs. 50/- <br/>We tried the Walnut fudge, which is essentially sizzling brownie with walnuts. Served on hot palm-sized black pans, the brownie can be relished by two people. Taste wise, its rich and succulent. Its remarkable that they make their own brownies which has a fresh home-bake feel.<br/>The second one we tried was the Ferrero Rocher Brownie, which had a coffee flavored brownie and ice cream topped with a full piece Ferrero Rocher. Looks royal and irresistibly indulgent. It was actually better than the previous one. <br/>They have 1-2 large family size brownie dishes too. <br/>Sizzling brownie, as a place, is too simple and budgety hence it still lacks the attraction that pulls a customer. They need to work a lot in order to gain popularity and grow.<br/>Overall, a happy experience with a quiet charm. This place is slowly catching waves, yet its never crowded even on weekends. I personally feel its a better choice here than spending 100 bucks over an ice-gola. Drop by after Dinner, and cherish moments of yummy sizzly Brownie with your loved ones. <br/><br/>Sizzling Brownie its time now you really SIZZLE!",4,"Reviews of Sizzling Brownie, Bodakdev, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/sizzling-brownie-bodakdev

So this place just focuses on Brownies and that too sizzling one.. I tried Evergreen Sizzling Brownie which is common in all.. Small piece of brownie, vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce added to it.. Another one which I have tried was All In Chocolate Sizzling Brownie which I liked more as compare to Evergreen Sizzling Brownie.. If you are chocolate lover then I think All In Chocolate should be given try as it is full combination of chocolate.. Piece of brownie, chocolate ice cream and chocolate sauce..

And if my taste wasn't enough, my friends and family have started appreciating my taste for a change. Chocolate Excess, Truffle Magic, Milk Chocolate, and the Pineapple hummingbird cakes have bled saliva, like literally! The gentle lady at the shop is really very co-operative and always smiling, now that i am a frequent visitor there! I snatch a little half a star because, several times, the place has been a little messy. With such high quality desserts and cakes on offer, I think this one is a bit a din on the overall goodness of the place.

Big chunks of excellent quality chocolate slightly warmed in between a sliced croissant. Its heavenly, I can assure you.<br/><br/>Everything was so pretty, I couldn't stop myself from taking pictures. The owner is very sweet. She said that they were in the process of updating their menu and 2 May would see the launch of the new menu.

But if somebody wishes to sit and have something to eat the place gives the warmest of welcome to all. <br/><br/>I like to have some coffee with sum muffins there. But recently i ordered a Blue Berry Cheese cake there for a friends B'day. And it was too good. A friend commented that she had Cheese cakes back in USA and this 1 was near to it. So in an all I was happy with my choice of cake. Apart from Cheese cake they serve real nice Tiramisu only on Order though but it too tastes amazing and is fresh and well prepared. Like it too, <br/><br/>But i had a disappointment lastly with the Cup Ckaes They served me it was Hard may be not even fresh, the Icing on it was too sweet and the colour essence was too high on the Pineapple cup cake and even the muffin was not that good. Apart from that the Layered Cake was awesome was too good. I havent personally tasted the chocolate here but have gifted it to couple of freinds and they say its good too. <br/><br/>So in an all the place is with mild Twist must Visit it for its warm Ambience and food with twist. <br/><br/>Food: 3.5<br/>Ambience: 4<br/>Service: 3.5",3,"Reviews of Brown & Happy, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/brown-happy-navrangpura

Viraj Chandarana,https://www.zoma.to/qaKggq,"Very candidly @7violettes has always occupied a very special place in my heart. The reason behind that is that it was the only place in town that prepared authentic French bakery items for a long time until new places with same concept sprung up recently. If I put it in a funny about why I have a soft corner is that, after we moved to India it was the owner of 7V who arranged my reunion with Baguettes, Madeleine, Croisssant and Pain-au-Chocolat and this happened after almost 14 years.<br/><br/>My Mom‚Äôs birthday was coming up and it was quite a time since I ordered something from 7V, I thought let me order something, I checked their menu and my eyes stopped at a cake called Dark Chocolate Orange Roasted Almonds. The best part about 7 V is the way they have explained every cake they make. This one goes by ‚ÄúCandied orange layered in sinful dark chocolate ganache and some roasted almonds to add to the flavor and texture‚Äù. Till the time I ended reading I had decided and said to myself ‚ÄúAapde aaj cake order karvi che, anyhow‚Äù.<br/><br/>So I placed an order for a 500 GMS cake, if you see the above picture you will think this looks like a very simple cake but my friend you are wrong just swipe to the next photo and you will understand everything. I will only say this cake was sinful, we just loved the combination of candied orange with almonds and dark chocolate, specially my mother who could not just stop praising the cake.<br/><br/>Thank you 7V for making her day‚Ä¶<br/><br/>Lastly I am a big fan of their Multi Grain bread, believe me they make the best one. You will agree to me once you try it.",4,"Reviews of 7Violettes, Prahlad Nagar, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/7violettes-prahlad-nagar

Chinmayee,https://www.zoma.to/XEnGNZ,"This place had always been on my list since the day I came to Ahmedabad! I had been dying to try the Irani chai and bun maska here and that's the first thing I did when I came here early in the morning at 6.30am. The waiter was nice enough and didn't serve me stale leftover buns from last night (told me himself he wouldn't give me that) and brought me fresh hot Irani chai and a bun maska. The chai was thick and creamy and not overly sweet. The bun maska was delicious! Fresh sweet buns slathered with white creamy makhan was the best start for my day! I could have eaten atleast a.few more of those, these buns were that light and fluffy! I also ordered the mutton kheema, and I really am surprised they had it in the menu that early. It didn't smell stale and tasted quite good! I'm going to head there again soon to try some more of their dishes! Recommendations are welcome!",4,"Reviews of New Irani Restaurant, Bhadra, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/new-irani-restaurant-bhadra
Ami Desai,https://www.zoma.to/amLrNe,"Based on my experience of Irani restaurants in Pune, I know that the best Maska bun can be found only at such an Irani restaurant and in Ahmedabad, I searched out this 'New Irani Restaurant' via Zomato.<br/><br/>Ambience: Why I am starting with Ambience first has a particular reason. The ambience might shock you. Its like an old, old place where there are more bricks than paint, and it might seem like something happened to the place and might be under renovation, but it's not. So, do prepare to get a non-New restaurant but do go if you like Maska bun. Hence the -1*.<br/><br/>Food: If you really want a yummm Maska bun then go for it. They apply their own made white butter (I may be partial as I like white butter more than the regular one) between the buns and it just tastes yumm. Tea is okayish so not something that can make me go till there. Hence the 4*.<br/><br/>Service: Okayish, nothing special, nothing bad.<br/><br/>",4,"Reviews of New Irani Restaurant, Bhadra, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/new-irani-restaurant-bhadra
Jayesh Tekwani,https://www.zoma.to/YaYxpq,'Irani' is an 80 years old cafe which has not been renovated since it was opened and they make all the food in iranian way and serve in typical 'amdavadi' (old city) type the most special dish here is 'chai' and 'half maska bun' yes they offer half maska bun too and omelette sandwich also has a unique sweet and spicy taste,4,"Reviews of New Irani Restaurant, Bhadra, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/new-irani-restaurant-bhadra

Kiran Sood,https://www.zoma.to/yyKqYa,"I reached Irani restaurant on recommendation from a friend in Gujarat. After walking 800mts. from Manek Chowk, amidst the insane Diwali crowd of eager shoppers, I felt extremely disappointed seeing the exterior of Irani Restaurant. In fact I thought they probably are undergoing rennovation or have ahut shop. On reaching closer, oh my God, not a single table was empty and the queue in the payment counter took my breath away. I knew that very moment, the long walk was worth it. <br/><br/>It was 4pm by the time I reached and imagine not a single table empty at an hour like that, big deal! Bun maska seems to be the most popular dish for the evening snacker there and then the real thing- mutton keema and mutton bhuna. I ordered a plate of both and the minute I had put the mutton bhuna first bite in my mouth with roti, I was sure why my friend had strongly recommended the place. The mutton pieces melted in my mouth. The masalas were perfectly blended. The curry was just the kind of curry you want your mutton in. Well cooked (that's an understatement), balanced spices and the freshness of the meat, my every bite made me feel even hungrier than before. I generally eat two rotis. I finished 4.<br/><br/>Irani Restaurant is the last place on earth you would probably imagine serving non-veg of this quality but then oh my God, you need to taste it to believe it. Clearly, it won't be a false claim if I say, they make the best mutton in Ahmedabad. I finished a meal of two dishes qith four rotis and a chai with bun maska and the bill came to be just Rs. 370.",5,"Reviews of New Irani Restaurant, Bhadra, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/new-irani-restaurant-bhadra

Sharmi Sen,https://www.zoma.to/pDORoO,"Had initially ordered a 500gm dry chocolate cake via Swiggy. After accepting the order and after quite some time had passed, a Swiggy executive called me up to inform that the cafe doesn't have that particular option and would offer a dry plum cake in lieu. The call was transferred to an executive at the cafe,who informed me that they have run out of stock for basic chocolate cakes, which was a bit surprising. Chocolate cakes are the most basic, staple cakes one can order.<br/>The plum cake was spongy, soft and lived upto expectations.

Biting Bowl,https://www.zoma.to/QvaOpZ,"I have been visiting TGB Cafe & Bakery ever since it has opened and never have I been disappointed. Lately I simply enjoy their peppermint flavours ie both chocolate peppermint and vanilla peppermint. Being a hardcore chocolate lover I am fond of their chocolate flavours like Chocolate ball, chocolate bbq, lava cup cake, chocolate walnut brownie, Belgian chocolate, dutch truffle, chocolate oreo, chocolate bourbon. The good thing is none of them are overly sweet.  Ravishing would be a perfect word here.¬†<br/><br/>The most interesting thing is that they keep coming up with new flavours and thus making one go back over and over again. <br/><br/>TGB Cafe & Bakery  is a cozy little place with ever smiling and ever welcoming people behind the counter. Ambiance is beautiful. You can surely spend some time here relishing pastries and puffs. <br/><br/>Apart from cakes and pastries, you can also have quick bites likes Chinese Cornetto, Masala Kulcha, Veg Puff, Kolhapuri Puff, Kadai Paneer Puff, Mexican Puff etc.  Milk shakes like Super Strawberry & Brownie blast are awesome.",4,"Reviews of TGB Cafe N Bakery, Navrangpura, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/tgb-cafe-n-bakery-navrangpura

Have been exploring some restraunts and caf√©s here. Yesterday we went to this quaint little glass and wood facade called The Soul Square. It's your quintessential hole in the wall appearance but you get pleasantly surprised to the warmth that imbues. It is a cozy corner for anyone who walks in. The staff is friendly. Their heartfelt thoughts have gone into making this place is amply visible by the vibe and the simplest thing like their menu card. It is interesting and asymmetric. Good options for a caf√© and tasty too. Though I have moved on to very less spices so I found it a slight bit spicy but the better half found the food outstanding. We had chicken lagana and green crostini.. Their cappuccino is also strong and hust the way it should be... Loved the whole experience...

I never expected a restaurant from ahemdabad to masterfully cook foreign cuisine! Best of all, i ordered their 'K Bomb' from Zomato and I never thought that presentation of food in a box could be nailed so well! I literally felt like I underpaid them for the food. Also I'd like to add that they definitely did not skimp out on quantity. The 'K Bomb' that I ordered had two seperate buns and I could barely eat 1 and a half. So at least as far as Korean chicken items are concerned, I would buy again from Soul Square blindly!

Chintan Thakkar,https://www.zoma.to/BEGrKq,"So one more visit to Danny's this time the one near IIM. Again I had try the cold coffee with topping. I also ordered the DFP puff and the Danny's special sandwich. <br/><br/>The cold coffee is their signature drink and it manages to please me every time, I notice a slight change in the taste but there isn't anything I disliked. <br/><br/>The DFP puff was a surprise altogether. It tasted totally different that what I had at an another outlet of Danny's. It was better then the other outlet. It was right amount of spicy and cheesy. If you like puffs it's a must have for you.<br/><br/>The Danny's special sandwich somehow came in form of a Panini. It was much like the DFP puff but only the puff was way better. <br/><br/>Now if you want to sit back and eat this is not the place for you. Its crowded and doesn't even have sitting space. However you can sit on the stairs or your two wheeler if you don't mind. There is nothing to complain about the ambiance as it's has been like this since inception and everyone there enjoys it's feel. It has it's own character and most of us who visit this outlet like it. The staff isn't that responsive but it's quick enough. I really like that all the Danny's outlets are economical and pocket friendly. Our bill was around 200 bucks which is quite economical considering the quantity and  quality. With more responsive staff members it will surely have my missing points. <br/><br/><br/>Thank you for reading <br/>The Tummy Man",3,"Reviews of Danny's Coffee Bar, Vastrapur, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/dannys-coffee-bar-vastrapur

I am not a tomato soup fan; but I have become a big fan of this soup now! They also had put some effort in the presentation of the food.<br/>Andr√© welcomed us with great care and ensured that we were comfortable and were enjoying the food. Do talk to him when you visit; he has many stories to tell (with various accents)! :)<br/>The ambiance is not flashy, but the space is good to have private conversations or hang out with friends, spend sometime alone or work alone, have formal and informal meetings, small and medium size gatherings in the interior as well as open space.<br/>Overall the place deserves a visit at least once.

Anupriya Singh,https://www.zoma.to/MoRebr,"While on our visit to the Lal Darwaja, i wanted to visit the famous eating joints too. That is the fun of a day long shopping spree. Read about the Mansuri Halwa here on zomato and also got a suggestion from a friend. So we found our way to this humble sweet shop at a corner, famous for its varieties of halwas. We tried the gulab lassi, a rose flavoured lassi that was priced at a meagre Rs 20. Nothing can be better than this lassi to beat the heat. The kesari rabri was thick and creamy with just the right hint of saffron,quite different from the laccha rabris. There serve a simple plate with no garnishings of essence of dry fruits.We also tried the lauki ka halwa and pineapple halwa, both served in a 100 gm quantity as tasting dishes. The lauki ka halwa was delicious, rich with mawa and left me wanting for more. We dod not like the pineapple halwa very much as it tasted of added pineapple essence. It was however, a rich halwa with dry fruits also. Wanted to try the anjeer halwa and gulab jamuns that it is also popular for, but   were completely full. Also regret not getting anything packedd from here.111",4,"Reviews of Mansuri Halwa, Bhadra, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/mansuri-halwa-bhadra

Asked what's best and the elderly person at the shop suggested Mango halwa, which was oozing with the taste of mango! Asked him for another flavor & this time it was pineapple, which was equally crazy. You can try 50gms at Rs.20, a kilo being Rs.400. They last more than 5 days without a fridge, giving me an idea of dropping by once more before leaving for home. As I paid, I couldn't stop from praising the person, but he chose to signal his hands towards the heaven. Divine intervention, indeed.

We asked to taste and a spoonfull of anjir halwa, dryfruit halwa and milk cake or dudh no halwo were served in a steel plate with steel spoons. <br/>The first bite and heaven was found. The dry fruit halwa is full of cashew nuts, almonds, anjir etc every bite fills ur mouth with flavor. The milk cake is what we settled down on for dessert. It tasted of fresh ghee, soft, dissolving in the mouth. Dinner was now complete. <br/>They also serve various other flavors of halwa like orange, strawberry, anjir etc. But that is for another day, for that night we were completly satiated and gad that we took that small walk.",4,"Reviews of Mansuri Halwa, Bhadra, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/mansuri-halwa-bhadra

That really helped in deciding in favor of anjeer halwa and dry fruit halwa. Every one at home, and at office liked the taste, and brought the nod of appreciation.

The good thing about this place is that you can taste the sweets before ordering any. They serve you a generous quantity for tasting and i just loved that. I tried the dry fruit halwa which was delicious. Laden with ghee, mawa and dry fruits, this halwa is pure sin. We tasted the kesari rabri which was too good but we keep that for next time. A dish that looked unique was the gulab jamun cutlets. Gulab jamuns shaped into loaves and cut into pieces, this one was a new take on the sweet. Another sweet that we tried was the ' aflatoon '.

And then the taste exploded. There was no way we could stop at one spoon. We needed more. Ran into the kitchen and grabbed the box of mithai and had some more. Only after we had satiated our taste buds, did we even bother to check the name of the mithai and where it was from. She informed it was from Mansuri Halwa Corner, a shop that has variety of just halwas.<br/>The halwas are really finger licking and since they are drenched in ghee and have dry fruits, they are good during the winters.",5,"Reviews of New Mansuri Halwa Corner, Sarkhej, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/new-mansuri-halwa-corner-sarkhej

So on my way I saw this place and thought to myself that a lassi is healthier than a pastry.  Yea my sweet tooth took over my brain. And I ordered a cashew almond lassi. And earlier I had tried their mango lassi and Chhas. And this one like the others I tried was great !!! Generous amount of dry fruit and they got a good standard lassi as a base. Must tryyyyyyyyy !!!

Dr. Shrenuj Shah,https://www.zoma.to/GEKmvZ,"A very famous place for pedas situated on the Anandnagar road. Have tried their kesar peda, dhana peda, thabdi peda and elichi peda.

Anupriya Singh,https://www.zoma.to/vGLwxN,"Ever since my husband travelled to Bhavnagar for the first time, it was a mandate to bring back home the famous pedhas and bhavnagari kachoris for me. Anyone travelling from bhavnagar, i had to ask for them for sure. My love for sweets and these pedhas did not go in vain, they expanded and came to Ahmedabad. No more waiting for travel plans.<br/>They have a variety of pedhas, the kesar elaichi, mawa peda, the kesar pedha,the thabdhi pedha etc. I am a big fan of the white pedhas and brown pedhas ( that' s how i call them ). They are soft, melt in the mouth and you feel the mawa in each bite.They have other sweets also but i have never think beyond the pedhas. The farsan section is also one with huge varieties. The kachoris are one thing i love,with a sweet and spicy daal and dry fruits filling in a crisp shell, they are the tea time hot sellers in my house.They sell fresh and hot snack items like dhokla, khaman, patras etc, only on sundays though.<br/>I make sure to carry box full of these back home and everyone just loves them. Also i got prasadi packs made for my house warming which was done very well by them. Small baxes with 4 pedhas each neatly packed and handed over to guests saved me from the task of disribution of prasad.<br/>One of the best sweet shops in ahmedabad.",4,"Reviews of Das Pendawala, Vejalpur, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/das-pendawala-satellite

What i loved more den the pedas is the orange barfi. Its way top delicious. Its natural.

Kathak Mehta,https://www.zoma.to/zLbQm,"Last week, I reached Das Pendawala in search of Undhiyu. Undhiyu I could not get as they serve only on Sundays, but instead I came out with boxes full of sweets. They have a wide range of sweets from penda to barfis and more. Authentic pendas is something you would find in Rajkot. But Das has the closest best pendas. I bought some Anjir patra, Khajur pak from their winter specials, soan papdi and the tempting looking kaju katri. Anjir patra were the best of all. Khajur pak tasted slightly different (or I would say weird) from how it usually is supposed to be. Kaju katri was good except I would personally enjoy it a little less sweet. I saw many variants of gulab jamun here but most of them were ready-to-eat packs. <br/><br/>All the sweets at Dasrange rom anywhere between Rs. 300/- per kg upto Rs. 700/- per kg. Most of the sweets looked freshly made and the store also happens to be clean and hygienic.",3,"Reviews of Das Pendawala, Vejalpur, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/das-pendawala-satellite

The shop has recently been renovated and is one of the best places to shop for snacks in vejalpur. They have a huge variety of namkeens, sev, gathiyas, puris and  bhakarwadis.The fried peanuts coated in besan and masala and  chana jor garam are my favourites from here. <br/>    They make fresh snack items like dhokla, nylon khaman, patra, samosas, kachori and jalebi.My sunday breakfast is sorted in case i do not wish to prepare anything. It is the chutneys and the kadhi that makes a dish complete for me and they are good at making them too. <br/>   They have quite a few variety of sweets also. The kala jamun, gulab jamuns, kaju katli, pedas being the popular ones. The boondi  laddoos are also good. The pedas  are good and i have sent them out of station also for relatives who appreciated them a lot. The prasadi pedha and mathura pedha are the best of all. The rest of the sweets i did not try and some of them did not appeal much to me. There are a few that seem to contain artificial colours in large quantities. <br/>    Recommended for dry snack items and farsaan.

For The Love Of Food,https://www.zoma.to/qNeBxl,"The food, hygiene and service is awesome. Though I found it to be a little over priced. We had:<br/><br/>5 in 1 Paratha - 5star. Show stealer.<br/><br/>Palak cheese Paneer - again great. Freshly chopped palak and cheese. Couldn't go wrong with it.<br/><br/>Methi cheese - This was a okayish in taste. The methi wasn't quite mixing with the cheese making the dish more bitter. This could be passed on.<br/><br/>Cheese Tomato - This wasn't on the menu but again came out to be a pretty descent combination<br/><br/>Dal Makhni chawal - I loved the the dish to the core. Although the dal had too much rajma in it and didn't have the makhani texture to it. But the taste was impeccable. I would sughest them to just change the name to Kali Dal chawal as calling it makhni was a bit unfair.<br/><br/>Pani Puri - Nylon puris served with superb home made pani served with bundi, sindhi style. This was great as well.<br/><br/>All in all a good Sunday dinner. Best wishes to the aunty and her family. Mpre power to them.

Suresh is a MBA with specialization in Finance, a trained Banker CUM Tea Lover CUM a Blogger, a Cook, a Sportsperson and above all an amazing Marketing guy. He has been in the corporate mundane field for close to 5 years before he took tea Personally. <br/><br/>That's when he tried his hands at recreational consulting and started the activity/creativity method of transforming stress in personal and professional lives. It was a unique way of letting one's hair down in an exclusive setup like the PERFECT CUP. He was already into Creative Branding & Marketing and now with PC he also had a unique Activity hub. Perfect Cup was a cross between a Perfect Tea and Coffee which is requirement of every Indian.   Perfect Cup which is synonymous with a place that's super approachable but even in the hustle bustle one still gets their attention and craving satisfactions. The other Chaipatti (Tea leaves going into a nice cup of bed tea or breakfast tea) is the freshest thing to begin one's day in the morning (Most people start their day with a nice cup of Tea) and here at Perfect Cuo that's an experience one can expect. <br/><br/>Perfect Cup being synonymous with Chai/Coffee soon got us thinking and setting up our very first Chai Shack or Teafe(Tea Cafe short form) as we call it. It was purely on impulse that got us the spot, the shack like roadside ambience with floor seating, very rustic with lots of colours and of course suresh donning the host's role. Perfect Cup Teafe is a Chai place for the best Chai, Coffee, Maggi, Pakodas and so many other things.",5,"Reviews of Perfect Chinese, Satellite, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/perfect-chinese-food-truck

Like the other day we had guests at our place and we decided to take them here and when we reached the restaurant was booked last minute for some function of 50 people and so was closed to others.<br/><br/>On the other occasion we wanted to have a family lunch and we called one hour in advance to confirm if we could come and the management said yes then when we reached, there was a group that came for a get together and we were said no.

It was already in the corner of the buzzing Stadium Circle and now it has almost been secluded due to the Metro construction.<br/><br/>The cafe has a private feel to it and the ambience too is minimal yet engaging, the biggest plus are the bean bags which makes the dining as relaxing as the place. The food is god..infact above par, especially the paneer lababdar combo and the lasagna. The only downside to this place is the service.<br/><br/>I mean it seems the management isn't too concerned about operating this place as the servers/ attendants do not at all care for your presence at the premise.

Few beverages, coffees, shakes and juices are the drink options.<br/><br/>All good but nothing out of the ordinary.

There was noise from every side and super crowded corridors !<br/>Recess cafe is a part of Armoise Hotel, along with Autograph restaurant ! We realized that there was some official meet going on in the cafe and had to wait for around 20 minutes (well, I'm still not complaining, given that it was a Sunday!)  As I said the corridors were super noisy, crowded and full of families trying to take pictures (basically too small corridor too) though their seating in the lobby is very very comfortable and cosy ! <br/>The interiors were well done... And so my excitement to get into the cafe was even more ! Also the name Recess Cafe made me want to check it out ! <br/>The cafe interiors were a welcome change.... The decors were done in red and black colour ! I was happy with the place being quite small and limited seating ! <br/>There was seating in 3 types- a sofa with table, comfortable chairs with tables and a high-bar kind of chair with a long table ! We settled for the individual chairs as it was near to the bells on one side of the wall! Yes, recess and bells are synonymous, right !<br/>Overall I would say, it is very tastefully done, with a huge screen on one wall, an inviting- looking mocktail bar, a huge huge red chair specially for clicking pics, huge golden bells on one wall, designer graffitti on one side and some paintings in one corner.... Overall very upmarket !! The menu was a slightly twisted version of 'being different' but as I said we were hungry... We ordered our food quickly -<br/>Pasta arrabiatta - We ordered this one without the veggies this time ! Inspite of that... It was AWESOME! After a long long time I had a perfect made pasta ! The spices and the flavour were well balanced ! Serve with 2 crisp and flavorful garlic breads ! <br/><br/>Lemon iced tea- Woah! Huge mugful of iced tea ! So chilled and refreshing... Again perfect in taste ! Full marks for sweet-sour balance ! <br/><br/>Mexican pizza- I was skeptical about it.... But wait ! Again so so good ! It was a biscuit crust pizza topped with averagely spicy bean  mixture and some veggies ! This can be an ideal pizza.... One of its type ! I was impressed !! <br/><br/>Spinach corn checkers - brought on well presented with long, crisp an thin French fries ! This sandwich was a good change from cream loaded ones ! It was a grilled sandwich with spinach, corn and white sauce base ! The frenchfries were like an unexpected add-on !<br/>All the food was presented and brought about so neatly and perfect ! The portion size was apt ! I was impressed with the random ceramic crockery they use ! What a treat to eat here ! <br/>But wait! I stilll would like to point out 2 major loopholes : <br/>One thing Ofcourse which the staff couldn't help was noisy atmosphere ! Families with children shouting their way in and out of the cafe !<br/>Secondly and more disappointingly, when we were done with the food... There wasn't any staff available to attend to us ! We waited for the bill and finally got up and talked about it at the reception ! Even after that, we didn't get the bill for another 20 minutes ! The staff was definitely courteous.... But keeping somebody waiting to pay is wrong !! (Again, Sunday excuses an make me ignore the fact) ! They could do with some more staff, is what I feel !<br/><br/>I am definitely and eagerly coming back to Recess for a good break from not-so-great food at various other places !! I recommend !!",4,"Reviews of Recess - Armoise Hotel, C G Road, Ahmedabad | Zomato",https://www.zomato.com/ahmedabad/recess-armoise-hotel-c-g-road

We reach at Recess at 12:30pm-ish and it was comparatively emptier. Nice decor, a projector screen playing some songs and commercials and comfortable seating. In fact I really liked the rotating chairs. We quickly ordered two things: Cheese Chilly Garlic Bread and Alfredo Pasta. The garlic bread was actually nothing special. I blast of chilly and some cheese. The pasta was good and creamy and delicious. I am rating it a 3.5 considering other dishes on the menu should be quite a delight to taste.

Ajit,https://www.zoma.to/rRRboa,"Well this place brings back memories of Mondegar Cafe. Ambience is amazing.. they have seating for all types. Low seating for coffee and snacks, proper table seating for dining, higher seating for laptop work or a meeting. Whoever made this place thought a lot about the guests. If this place was on the main road and visible, it would have made wonders.¬†<br/><br/>I tried the toblerone shake!! Almost perfect. The rate was also very economical. I think the shake was 120.. common a toblerone chocolate costs about 150 rupees. They must have atleast put half the chocolate in the shake...<br/><br/>Their ¬†crockery is also classy.. all different colors.. I think they bought it from Mati ceramics in Paldi.. Only other place uses it I think is Tomatoes at CG road..<br/>Food wise, Indian combos have good options. I went there late night at 12.30, and so was craving some late night Indian food. Their rajma rice and dal khichdi was as good and more filling than Cafe Piano..!! ¬†outside the cafe they have a nice metal structure of Siddhi Syed Ki Jali!!¬†<br/><br/>A combo is enough for 2 ppl.. well until and unless u r starving. So very very economical... Everything late night is seen at SG Highway, finally a good option in navrangpura.

Only 1 type of roti (tava chapati).<br/>Buttermilk and papad - 1 serve only then charges are extra.
