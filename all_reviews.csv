The reason behind that is that it was the only place in town that prepared authentic French bakery items for a long time until new places with same concept sprung up recently. If I put it in a funny about why I have a soft corner is that, after we moved to India it was the owner of 7V who arranged my reunion with Baguettes, Madeleine, Croisssant and Pain-au-Chocolat and this happened after almost 14 years.<br/><br/>My Mom‚Äôs birthday was coming up and it was quite a time since I ordered something from 7V, I thought let me order something, I checked their menu and my eyes stopped at a cake called Dark Chocolate Orange Roasted Almonds. The best part about 7 V is the way they have explained every cake they make. This one goes by ‚ÄúCandied orange layered in sinful dark chocolate ganache and some roasted almonds to add to the flavor and texture‚Äù. Till the time I ended reading I had decided and said to myself ‚ÄúAapde aaj cake order karvi che, anyhow‚Äù.<br/><br/>So I placed an order for a 500 GMS cake, if you see the above picture you will think this looks like a very simple cake but my friend you are wrong just swipe to the next photo and you will understand everything. I will only say this cake was sinful, we just loved the combination of candied orange with almonds and dark chocolate, specially my mother who could not just stop praising the cake.<br/><br/>Thank you 7V for making her day‚Ä¶<br/><br/>Lastly I am a big fan of their Multi Grain bread, believe me they make the best one.

So i ordered aloo tikki burger, mexican twist burger, simply veg burger and kadhai paneer burger and some french fries to accompany it with. To start with kadhai paneer burger, it was stellar, i just loved how soft the bun were and the burger had exactly the same flavours that kadhai paneer has. The aloo tikki burger was quite the usual, simply veg burger was a great one and the patty was crispy and yum. I dint like the veg wrap though, it had alot of sauces and spices and it was quite difficult to chew. The french fries were crisp from the outer and soft from inside and i quite like it. The best thing i think about burgerlicious is that it is quite pocket friendly and had a good taste as compared to all the cafes and food places ahmedabad has, this one is the best place.

Good Hotel. A social business that re-invests its profits into education, training and entrepreneurship.\xa0Hotel ratings\xa0are often used to classify\xa0hotels\xa0according to their quality. The development of the concept of hotel rating and its associated definitions display strong parallels. From the initial purpose of informing travellers on basic facilities that can be expected, the objectives of hotel rating has expanded into a focus on the hotel experience as a whole.[1]\xa0Today the terms 'grading', 'rating', and 'classification' are used to generally refer to the same concept, that is to categorize hotels.<br/><br/>There is a wide variety of rating schemes used by different organizations around the world. Many have a system involving\xa0stars, with a greater number of stars indicating greater luxury.\xa0Forbes\xa0Travel Guide, formerly\xa0Mobil\xa0Travel Guide, launched its star rating system in 1958. The\xa0AAA\xa0and their affiliated bodies use\xa0diamonds\xa0instead of stars to express hotel and restaurant ratings levels.<br/><br/>Food services, entertainment, view, room variations such as size and additional amenities, spas and fitness centers, ease of access and location may be considered in establishing a standard. Hotels are independently assessed in traditional systems and rest heavily on the facilities provided. Some consider this disadvantageous to smaller hotels whose quality of accommodation could fall into one class but the lack of an item such as an\xa0elevator\xa0would prevent it from reaching a higher categorization.[2]<br/><br/>In recent years hotel rating systems have also been criticised by some[who?]\xa0who argue that the rating criteria for such systems are overly complex and difficult for laypersons to understand. It has been suggested that the lack of a unified global system for rating hotels may also undermine the usability of such schemes.<br/><br/>"", 'rating': 4}, {'author': 'Kishorbhai', 'description': 'This is nice place to have food because of quality of food, wall painting , humorous slogan written everywhere.<br/><br/>Noticed that this place is always full .<br/><br/>Variety of food in buffet breakfast , dinner they serve.<br/><br/>Nice atmosphere too.', 'rating': 3}, {'author': 'Asnath Ndosi', 'description': ""Great ambiance- its colorful, inviting and you get to enjoy you meal while laughing (the placemats are hilarious)<br/><br/>Friendly waiters- they are warm and cater to your needs.<br/><br/>Good food.

This year I had been waiting for Onam, so I could relish Sadhya. Earlier, I had Sadhya once and that too in Ahmedabad only, so I couldn't vouch for the authenticity of food. I chose Dravida this time because I had heard good reviews regarding their Onam Sadhya festival.<br/><br/>In the morning, I contacted Mr Suvankar Roy regarding reservations, but he replied that they don't take reservations as their policy for that day was on a first come first serve basis. Though when we reached there to our surprise they had a few tables reserved for the guests; but we didn't have to wait for our table.<br/><br/>It was just the second time I was trying a Sadhya meal, and was excited as ever.  The starters came in a few minutes after we were seated. For starters, there was Pathimugam Water, Rasam Soup, Uzhunnu Vada and Kappa Milagu Perrati. On the menu, salad 'thayir' was also mentioned, but I guess it was not served. Rasam Soup, Uzhunnu Vada & Kappa Milagu Perrati were delicious, but Pathimugam Water's taste didn't suit my tastebuds. I even repeated Uzhunnu Vada. Kappa Milagu Perrati was made from tapioca, and it was unique experience to try it. Rasam was soothing. In fact, Papads and chutneys were also served in starters. I didn't find Papad the authentic one, though all the chutneys betteroot, coconut & tomato were great.<br/><br/>The main course was served in thali. I wanted to experience Sadhya in a traditional way on Banana leaf, so I got a bit disappointed. There were many dishes in the thali as shown in the photo attached. There were plenty of curries were served with three types of breads and rice. I guess Sadhya is more about rice than breads if I am not wrong, but their main focus were on breads. Kal Dosa, Appam & Malabari Paratha were included in breads, all three were amazing. Especially Appam & Kal Dosa. Kal Dosa's texture was soft & spongy. We enjoyed Appam with Olan. Olan was prepared with White-Ash Gourd, Black Chana & Coconut Milk, and complimenting well with Appam. I also liked Keerai Masiyal, Avial & Sambar, but nothing tasted like you could say wow! I wanted to enjoy most of the curries with rice, but till the time I felt almost full.<br/><br/>In desserts, we had Payasam, Coconut Barfi & Kerala Elaichi Banana. Payasam was a tad bit sweeter for my liking and Coconut Barfi was okay.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, the food was good, but nothing you would remember for a long time. The experience was polished than the authentic one.<br/><br/>The steward (forgot his name) was on his toe all the time, he was polite & well-behaved too, but he was also nervous as well or rather I would say not well-versed with all the dishes. Apart from the names, he could not suggest us the combinations of dishes which could taste good together.<br/><br/>I paid Rs.3255/- for two for fine-dine experience.<br/><br/>It was my first time to visit Dravida, so I would like to give them a second chance for food by going there on non-festival days."", 'rating': 3}]"

I was so warm and cuddly and well entertained that I sincerely didn't want to enter the eating area proper when the time came. <br/><br/>But enter we did and ordered food like no one had fed us for a week. There were 4 dal battis, 2 paneer tikka masala, 2 lasaniya bataka, chaas, soup, masala papads, paneer chilly, rotis.

I always wait there whenever i am in paldi area for delicious samosas and kachori. Once when i was returning home from satellite via mansi crossroads i saw this small shop which announced Indore chat house. I was extremely happy as now i didn\'t had to travel from drive in road to paldi. But then first i had to be sure that they are the genuine indore chat house. There was no doubt  of me not trying the new branch. So i ate a kachori there itself and decided to take two samosas as take away. The staff is neither rude nor friendly , Just normal. The ambiance is not too attractive either. Just a small tiny shop having a few stools in the indoors. And moreover it has no ventilation and is quite hot inside.The kachori was served with two mixed chutneys i.e. the sweet brown chutney and spicy pudina chutney. The consistency of chutneys was very thin though tasty. The kachori was hot, fresh , crispy and delicious but to my badluck it was moong dal kachori. I like the onion kachoris more. The samosas which i took as take away had remained hot and did not become soggy unlike the other places. The same old taste of spicy delicious samosas with generous amount of filling filled into it. However the mixed chutneys had changed to color. It went black dont know why. I suggest eating eating at around 4 pm for freshly made samosas and kachoris. Moreover they should add onion kachoris in their menu. And i suggest while you eat take your plate outside to avoid suffocation.

We immediately changed our minds and stopped here. Ambiance is quite normal. A small shop, which has a few bamboo stools kept at the outdoor but the interior is well designed by a few green hangings which gives a fresh look to the shop. We were  around 4 people and wanted to order different flavors of cane juice. They serve salt & pepper, lemon , mint and a few other. We didn't go for salt &pepper, i mean salt with sugarcane? So we ordered mint , lemon , just sugarcane juice and one more which i don't remember. They took around 2 minutes to make our juices. They make it front of you ensuring that it isn't one which is made hours ago. The size of the glasses were not up to the mark. I found them small, maybe this is because i loved the drink too much. The other flavors i.e. mint and lemon were good enough but me being a natural food loved found the authentic sugarcane juice just awesome. Yes the consistency was a big lead down. The gurantee full hygienicity as it is made without human touch. But the consistency of the juice was so thin. Natural cane juice isn't so less consistent, but who is gonna question the honesty of a machine. Anyways all matters is you like what you eat or drink which was completely fulfilled.I am happy that it is near my house and so i can be a regular customer there.

Also, this place not being Mumbai, I had given up on any street food breakfast stalls, let alone any restaurants to be operational this early in the day. I was on a bus, and this locality, despite being very close to Ahemdabad\'s\xa0main railway junction, looked very vintage with the old style architecture and no proper buildings and stuff. Just then my eyes crossed this only building standing tall, and there it was"" Moti Bakery, open and ready to serve. I literally got off the bus and walked in to get something in my growling stomach.\xa0<br/><br/>I did not have very high hopes, even some puff or samosa would be good enough, but what did we have here, they also served Pizza, burgers, and rolls! Lucky me! Well, sadly this particular outlet of the popular brand of Moti Bakery did not serve non-veg, but for a hungry young man such as myself, even ghass-phoos would make me more than happy at the moment.<br/><br/>I liked this bakery and its products so much that I ended up coming here thrice in the 2 days I was at Ahemdabad! Not only that, but I also took sweets and munchies back home from here too. Moti bakery was sort of a lifesaver, as I did not have to look around a lot for getting some edible souvenirs from Ahemdabad, and it offered amazing snacking and dessert options!<br/><br/>I tried their pizza, paneer rolls, and paneer puff in savories, for the sweet dish it was ras malai and gulab jamun, with a box of milk cake and Mohanthad for home. I also got a box of their assorted cookies, which had at least\xa08 different types of cookies in it, and their super crunchy and buttery breadsticks which tasted delicious just by themselves, offering a salty as well as sweet tang. Each and every product was loveable! I wouldn\'t mind stepping in here for a quick grub when I am in Ahemdabad next, and its proximity\xa0to the railway junction would even allow me to do so practically!

Rs. 25.

The mutton pieces melted in my mouth. The masalas were perfectly blended. The curry was just the kind of curry you want your mutton in. Well cooked (that's an understatement), balanced spices and the freshness of the meat, my every bite made me feel even hungrier than before. I generally eat two rotis.

That's when we came across this Armoise Hotel near Havmor ! I had read about this cafe through some food pages... Wherein foodies had described about their good experiences with this place! <br/>It was kind of late and we were too hungry and tired ! I was quite hopeful about the place... Though the moment I entered.... There was noise from every side and super crowded corridors !<br/>Recess cafe is a part of Armoise Hotel, along with Autograph restaurant ! We realized that there was some official meet going on in the cafe and had to wait for around 20 minutes (well, I'm still not complaining, given that it was a Sunday!)  As I said the corridors were super noisy, crowded and full of families trying to take pictures (basically too small corridor too) though their seating in the lobby is very very comfortable and cosy ! <br/>The interiors were well done... And so my excitement to get into the cafe was even more ! Also the name Recess Cafe made me want to check it out ! <br/>The cafe interiors were a welcome change.... The decors were done in red and black colour ! I was happy with the place being quite small and limited seating ! <br/>There was seating in 3 types- a sofa with table, comfortable chairs with tables and a high-bar kind of chair with a long table ! We settled for the individual chairs as it was near to the bells on one side of the wall! Yes, recess and bells are synonymous, right !<br/>Overall I would say, it is very tastefully done, with a huge screen on one wall, an inviting- looking mocktail bar, a huge huge red chair specially for clicking pics, huge golden bells on one wall, designer graffitti on one side and some paintings in one corner.... Overall very upmarket !! The menu was a slightly twisted version of 'being different' but as I said we were hungry... We ordered our food quickly -<br/>Pasta arrabiatta - We ordered this one without the veggies this time ! Inspite of that... It was AWESOME! After a long long time I had a perfect made pasta ! The spices and the flavour were well balanced ! Serve with 2 crisp and flavorful garlic breads ! <br/><br/>Lemon iced tea- Woah! Huge mugful of iced tea ! So chilled and refreshing... Again perfect in taste ! Full marks for sweet-sour balance ! <br/><br/>Mexican pizza- I was skeptical about it.... But wait ! Again so so good ! It was a biscuit crust pizza topped with averagely spicy bean  mixture and some veggies ! This can be an ideal pizza.... One of its type ! I was impressed !! <br/><br/>Spinach corn checkers - brought on well presented with long, crisp an thin French fries ! This sandwich was a good change from cream loaded ones ! It was a grilled sandwich with spinach, corn and white sauce base ! The frenchfries were like an unexpected add-on !<br/>All the food was presented and brought about so neatly and perfect ! The portion size was apt ! I was impressed with the random ceramic crockery they use ! What a treat to eat here ! <br/>But wait! I stilll would like to point out 2 major loopholes : <br/>One thing Ofcourse which the staff couldn't help was noisy atmosphere ! Families with children shouting their way in and out of the cafe !<br/>Secondly and more disappointingly, when we were done with the food... There wasn't any staff available to attend to us ! We waited for the bill and finally got up and talked about it at the reception ! Even after that, we didn't get the bill for another 20 minutes ! The staff was definitely courteous.... But keeping somebody waiting to pay is wrong !! (Again, Sunday excuses an make me ignore the fact) ! They could do with some more staff, is what I feel !<br/><br/>I am definitely and eagerly coming back to Recess for a good break from not-so-great food at various other places !! I recommend !!"", 'rating': 4}, {'author': 'Kutub Ujjaini', 'description': ""The menu card is not quite interesting that could hold up your eyes though I managed to order an ice tea.

Served on hot palm-sized black pans, the brownie can be relished by two people. Taste wise, its rich and succulent.

Looks royal and irresistibly indulgent. It was actually better than the previous one. <br/>They have 1-2 large family size brownie dishes too. <br/>Sizzling brownie, as a place, is too simple and budgety hence it still lacks the attraction that pulls a customer. They need to work a lot in order to gain popularity and grow.<br/>Overall, a happy experience with a quiet charm. This place is slowly catching waves, yet its never crowded even on weekends.

This place was introduced to me by my late Grandpa who was big fan of their dalwada. Big pieces of dalwada and methi gota always served hot is their speciality.<br/><br/>I have seen them grow their business from a road side Lari to well established shop. My school was next to this place and i still remember my class teacher during recess time asks us to get dalwada and bhajia from here, and when we come back with parcel they give us 1 piece dalwasa or 1 piece bhajia as a thank you. And for young student that was no less than diwali bonus.<br/><br/>One can get take away and also eat there. Previously if you want to eat there ony then there were banches where you can have snacks. In recent changes made in the shop they got rid of the banches and placed round high tables.<br/><br/>Ambiance: only part on whicch they should concentrate more. Because lots of people have dalwada and bhaia there only it is bit massy.. event hough they keep tables clean one could easily dind pieces of snacks on d floor.<br/><br/>Must Have: they serve only Dalwada and Methi Gota so there is nothing to choose that what to eat and what to not. But they are master of Dalwada. Good thing about place is that they make considerably small batch of dalwada and methi Gota at a time so one will never get cold item there. They serve both dalwada and got with sliced onions and green chilli.<br/><br/>Avoid: nothing that one can skip<br/><br/>Area of improvement: they need to work bit more on cleanliness. Also previously they had Kachori and Samosa on the menu and i still feel that in whole mani nagar area no one was serving such delicious kachori ad samosa. Somehow they have stopped making kachori and Samosa. I really wish these two items are still available.<br/><br/>They serve from 10am to 8:30pm, sometimes 9pm max. But after 7:30pm chances of getting dalwada starts decreasing rapidly. Sometimes have seen them winding up days business at 8pm only.<br/><br/>3 generation of my family is fan of the place. Grandpa then dad and me, and i know my young daughter will also grow up liking this place also. From my 20+ years of experience of this place made me give it 5 as rating.<br/><br/>Food: 5/5<br/>Ambiance: 3/5<br/>VFM: 5/5<br/>', 'rating': 5}]"
