# WhereToDine

## 📌 Overview
WhereToDine is an AI-powered restaurant recommendation system that helps users find the best dining options based on their preferences. The system leverages a hybrid recommendation model combining content-based and collaborative filtering to ensure accurate and personalized suggestions.

## 🎯 Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests restaurants based on user preferences, including cuisine type, price range, ambiance, and specific food items.
- **Hybrid Recommendation System**: Utilizes content-based filtering (restaurant attributes) and collaborative filtering (user reviews) for improved accuracy.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Analyzes restaurant features, reviews, and menu data to enhance recommendations.
- **User-Centric Filtering**: Allows users to filter recommendations based on location, food type, and budget constraints.
- **Review & Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluates customer reviews to identify trending dishes and user sentiments.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The project utilizes the following datasets:
1. **Restaurants Dataset**: Contains restaurant names, locations, cuisines, price range, and other key features.
2. **Reviews Dataset**: Includes customer ratings, review descriptions, and author details.
3. **Menu Dataset**: Lists menu items, pricing, and availability across different restaurants.

## 🔍 How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and structures data from restaurant listings, reviews, and menus.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts meaningful features from reviews, ratings, and restaurant descriptions.
3. **Hybrid Recommendation Model**:
   - **Content-Based Filtering**: Matches user preferences with restaurant attributes.
   - **Collaborative Filtering**: Leverages user reviews and ratings for better recommendations.
4. **User Query Processing**: Takes input (cuisine, budget, ambiance, dish preference) and returns the best matching restaurants.
5. **Result Optimization**: Filters out unsuitable options to ensure high-quality suggestions.

## 🚀 Deployment
- The system can be deployed as a **web application** or **API** to integrate with other platforms.
- Future enhancements may include **real-time user feedback** to refine recommendations further.

## 📌 Future Scope
- **Real-Time User Feedback**: Improve recommendation accuracy by incorporating user choices.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Enhance location-based recommendations using mapping APIs.
- **Mobile App Integration**: Expand accessibility through a dedicated mobile application.
